The room was perfect with an extraordinary bathroom! The view was boring, but how much time do you spend looking out? I loved the reserved elevator for rooms 52 and above, so we never waited more than 30 seconds. The pool area was very ordinary, not the main attraction, that's for sure. Only had breakfast at the restaurant, and very expensive ...But, isn't everything else in Vegas? Can't get a cocktail under $12.50, witch is a rip off if you ask me. Even a beer will cost you $8.50. The shopping center accross the street, the fashion show, is the perfect place to buy some beer at a normal price, or a nice bottle of rum...So you can enjoy in your beautiful suite at the Trump hotel! The only downside of this hotel is the walking distance to all the action...Get in shape people, because lots of walking in Vegas. Taxi's are a rip off, so be prepared.

The room is exceedingly large compared to, say, The Bellagio's, with sink, stove, refrig, closet, bookcase, etc. and one king bed and a pull-out sofa. The bathroom is equally large with huge shower and \"john\" areas. BUT, the carpets are stained...both in room and in halls. Mattress left much to be desired. It has user-unfriendly doors, i.e., each room is partioned off with another room and one has to enter two heavy doors before entering their rooms. This resulted in late-nighters slamming the doors twice when they returned to sleep. Additionally, we heard \"boom-boom\" music all night. Another guest? We never knew where it came from. Then we were \"hit\" with their $22.35 \"resort fee\" on check out but only used one bottle of water that falls under that category. The dining rooms are far from \"friendly\" in atmosphere and the lobby is just a large \"cold\" area. A plus might be that one can jaywalk across to the large shopping mall. For $50 more, we'd select The Bellagio any time we revisit Vegas. There you get a clean room/floor with no noise, and it's gorgeous. The Trump is a mistake we will not make twice.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":3,"Value":2,"Rooms":3,"Location":4},"date":"2015-09-06 19:45:04 +0300","author":"Angelica Block"},{"content":"We'd booked the Trump via the \"hidden name\" deals on Expedia. So it wasn't by choice that we stayed here, but it was a great stay overall. I was a little disappointed to learn that this was just a hotel and not a hotel/casino. But liked the fact that it is a smoke free facility, including the pool area (there is one small smoking section on the back patio). We checked in very late at night - around 1am, so there was no line. The clerk was courteous and friendly and remembered me when I checked out 2 days later. The lobby is exquisite, though sorta small compared to many other hotel/casinos in Vegas. They have a bar/lounge in the lobby and an adjacent restaurant. The service one of the best I've had in Vegas. Housekeeping was quick with orders for extra towels and water bottles. The doormen always had a smile and were attentive, and the shuttle drivers, were courteous and friendly (asked questions about our time in Vegas). PS - there is a free shuttle to the Wynn or to the Caesar's Forum Shops that runs very frequently throughout the day and into the night and also picks up from these locations. We stayed in a King Suite on the \"strip view\" side of the hotel. It did not disappoint. Great view of the strip including the Bellagio Fountains (though I don't think every room will have this same view). Kitchenette which includes a microwave, small stove (electric) and a fridge (bigger than a mini-fridge, but not full size). The suite also had a nice couch and two chairs along with a coffee table. Included in the suite was coffee (quick brew coffee maker) and bottled water (unlimited refills). The bed was a little firm, but I slept well. My girlfriend claimed that she didn't sleep as well, which is strange since she prefers a firmer bed than I do typically. There was a couple water spots on the ceiling in the bathroom that were questionable for a 5 Star hotel, and the toilet seat seemed to have a \"hinge\" problem, but fairly minor issues. The bathroom amenities were fantastic - large stand up shower, along with a huge spa bath, two sinks and a toilet that was partitioned off; it also included a t.v. in the mirror. The pool is great. Plenty of seating (at least in early September) on both Saturday and Sunday. It is large enough that you can actually swim laps (not quite olympic length, but long enough). There a about 10 cabanas for rent along with large round couch chairs for rent, or the free seating. The free seats are obviously first come first served, and don't come with umbrellas by default, but if available the life guards/pool attendants will bring one over for you. There is a bar and light restaurant right next to the pool. Drinks are typically overpriced, but you can order a tropical smoothie for $6-8 and add a shot of rum for $3 and have a very tasty drink. They also had a \"bucket of beers\" special - so ask. We didn't use the spa or the gym, but they looked nice. As stated in the beginning of this review, we booked this hotel via an \"unpublished rate\" deal, so we got the room at a discount. I would say that it was worth what we paid and generally speaking, this hotel is worth it if you are looking for a place where you can get first class service and a nice place to stay. As well, it's not so far off the strip and is right next to the fashion show mall (the entrance to Nordstrom is right across the street from the hotel).","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":5,"Location":4},"date":"2015-08-18 14:24:10 +0300","author":"Millie Lebsack"},{"content":"excellent hotel; stayed there for 4 nights and don't regret it. the hotel is well located, doesn't have all the hassle and overcrowdedness of a casino hotel and thus offers you a safe haven close to the classical strip... the rooms are spacious, of high quality and very very clean, the service and friendliness of the staff is among the best I have encountered in my life...

Hotel staff were very friendly and accomodating, while my room was clean, with a spacious bathroom. The bed was comfortable and the room quiet with an ice machine on each floor. I enjoyed the small, but adequate fitness center, which consisted of three treadmills, a bike and a cross trainer, along with some weights. The hot breakfast in the morning was certainly better then most, including everything from fresh fruit to prepared omlettes and sausage paddies. The breakfast room was spacious, updated and comfortable.

Out of all the hotels in downtown Indy, Hampton Inn seemed to garner the most positive reviews from people. Well I have to say that our experience at this hotel was absolutely fantastic. The staff, especially the front desk clerks, were friendly and helpful; the rooms were clean and nice, and the free hot breakfast provided every morning was top notch. The women who worked in the hot breakfast area were so nice, it was always a pleasure to talk with them in the morning.

When I reserved the room through my travel agent he requested that we have a crib for my grandson. When we arrived and checked in I asked if there was a crib in our room the lady said no but she would get me one as soon as her driver of the shuttle come back which would be about 15-20 minutes I told her that would be fine we would give my grandson a bath then he would use the crib. 30 minutes went by and I had looked out the window and seen the shuttle was back I called down to the front desk she again said no the shuttle hadn't been back yet and she would get it soon. 20 minutes later I walked out to my car and seen that the shuttle was there when I was going back into the hotel the shuttle was leaving so I had thought the crib was in the room when I got back to the room still no crib. I counted the shuttlle being back at the hotel 4 diffrernt times and still no crib. 1:30am I called to the front desk and asked I am going to get a crib she said yes mam as soon as the shuttle comes back I told her it had been back 4 times and my grandson is tired and so are we could I please get the crib. My son in law looked out the window and the shuttle was in front of the hotel I called down again she said I am sorry mam but I can't find one by then it was almost 2am I said thank you so much for getting me this crib in 20minutes I was very upset my grandson ended up sleeping on the floor what a nice start to a wonderful vacation.

Before booking a trip with this hotel, I was debating between Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons and Grand Wailea. I chose Ritz because of its overall value and my familiarity with the Ritz Carlton tradition of elegance and opulence. I was never wrong in choosing this hotel. I booked an ocean view Residential Suite and it was fantastic! I strongly recommend this hotel OVER Four Seasons and Grand Wailea, especially if you are a couple with no kids travelling. I visited Four Seasons and Grand Wailea but was never impressed! The pool in Ritz Carlton is way better than Four Seasons and even the beach in Ritz is great. Ritz Carlton is close to other beaches, among others is the Kapalua beach which is a great snorkeling site. Forget booking a trip to molokini or lanai, try this beach instead and you will save money and motion sickness (it was a bit wavy when we went there). The hotel offers free shuttle to Kapalua beach which is great for snorkeling. You could rent snorkel gear right there and charge it to your room account at Ritz (bring your room key). The Ritz Carlton is also next to a Catholic church with a shortcut right from the hotel free parking area, making it appear that the church belongs to the resort. In front of the resort is a store offering breakfast and lunch and this is very cheap place with great food, if you don't want to pay the $30/person buffet breakfast at the hotel. Other reviews mentioned the hotel location being windy; well, it was a breeze, not too windy which was actually good because it refreshes you; not sticky or humid. I visited the four seasons beach and it was more wavy for my taste than the beach in front of Ritz Carlton! It also didn't rain much when I was there. Kapalua area, where the hotel is, is secluded and ideal for honeymooners, lovers and those who want privacy. I saw some couple with kids, but not much. Overall, I love Ritz Carlton! The place has a sushi bar, lounge, the famous Banyan Tree restaurant, a beach restaurant, etc. YOU WILL NEVER GO WRONG WITH THIS HOTEL, FOR THIS IS THE BEST IN MAUI, hands down!","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2015-03-29 22:14:23 +0300","author":"Hans Turcotte"},{"content":"Was part of a major conference here for 6 nights. My Department was one of the \"sponsors\" of the conference. First the good: - Great meeting rooms and meeting staff - Very nice ( but not Great) hotel rooms. Extremely clean with great service at least twice a day. - We hosted a cabana by the pool one afternoon with Mango Ice tea, soda, water and Hawaiian Shave Ice. Other conference sponsors had Cabanas with specialty tropical cocktails. Excellent service by the staff - event was a big success. - Grounds are fantastic: multi-pool complex or walk (or ride) down a gently sloping hill to a well kept ocean beach with decent (but not huge) waves and a picturesque sandy beach. Excellent golf courses very nearby. - Fitness center was also good - free weights, weight machines and many treadmills, and several bikes, although 5 of the 6 elliptical/cross-trainers were not 100% functional at any given time ( no music or TV, no elevation, etc.). Now the bad: - We hosted a diner for about 35 people at the 5 star Banyan Tree restaurant on-site. We had selected a pre-set menu with the restaurant staff ahead of time. During the function, the waitstaff, on their own, decided to add an item (surf & turf) that was not agreed to and was priced above anything we agreed to. Additionally we ordered the \" wine by the bottle as it is used\" option. We witnessed the waitstaff filling wine glasses in front of children, empty seats,etc. We had three tables of about 12 people at each in one room. Service timing was weird: table 1 got their appetizers , then 15 minutes later table 2, then 15 minutes later table three - and the same for salads and the entrees. At the end of the night after their unecessary, continuous wine-pouring, we probably left 3 bottles of expensive wine in glasses on the table. Finally the bill got messed up. The amounts the restaurant charged on our receipts were lower than the amounts they had put on my Mastercard ( I had to call Mastercard several times). We did finally get everything resolved satisfactorily over the next two days with the help of the Ritz Accounting Dept. If I had to do this again, I would make it very clear that only the items on the pre-set menu were to be offered; let the guests order wine or drinks by the glass; and make sure I had an extra $10,000 in my credit-line to pay for the meal. Or better still go somewhere else ( i.e. Merriman's). Overall, the Banyan Tree experience was a negative and suprising ( for the Ritz) 2-day blot on an otherwise excellent conference and hotel experience.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":3,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-03-02 14:54:31 +0300","author":"Dr. Arno Lebsack"},{"content":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary and 4th of July in Maui. The Ritz is so beautiful. Despite the misc. complaints, I stayed there anyway. I am so glad I did. The resort is so beautiful, breathtaking and elegant. We were greeted so nicely by all the staff and even received a hawaiian necklace upon check in. We had an ocean view suite and saw the beautiful sunrise every morning from our balcony. The resort is very big but the beach is just a 5 minute walk from the main pool area. The beach is very private as you only see guests of the Ritz. The concierge was so helpful and booked all of our events that were first class, all we had to do was show up. I do have to advise you that the ocean view was a side view but it was still beautiful. I believe they also have ocean front rooms available. They played live soothing music in the lounge area. Tips: Grab your breakfast and lunch at the store on the resort and save your money for a nice dinner. Dinner on the resort can be pricey but it's expected when staying at the Ritz. Last but not least, I read about the wind and was somewhat apprehensive. It is a little windy but most of the island is, because of the trade winds. There's a reason why it is the surfing capital!

Most of the reviews we read on trip advisor are very accurate. Upon check in they upgraded us to an ocean view room even though we only paid for the basic room. Most of the rooms their have only a limited ocean view due to the layout of the hotel. The service at the hotel was very good from the Valet, Front Desk, and most Servers. The grounds are very nice and the Ocean view from the pools are unbelievable. The hotel is about a 3 minute walk to the beach so do not expect to be right on the beach like some other places but the walk is quick and they even provide a golf cart ride free of charge for you if you prefer. The rooms were very nice and the maid service was up to parr. Like other reviews stated the pool deck can be very windy but in Hawaii even a strong wind is not that cold. There was a few times where we had to wait longer than expected to get drinks in the outside pool bar area and they were not even that busy but other than that all of our service experiences were great. Kevin at the Terrace was great! The hotel is for the most part by itself so there are only a few places to walk to but if you do decide to stay here you should definitely go to \"The Gazebo\" for breakfast and get the macadamia and banana nut pancakes. Also even better than that is \"The PIneapple Grill\" Best restaurant I have ever been to. The pineapple upside down cake is a great desert and the fish and steaks there are great. Overall I really enjoyed this hotel. The only negative I have is that even though we got a good rate I forgot that the food ($20 omelet) drinks ($12 Pina Colada) and activities (my girlfriend paid $15 for a yoga class) would still be pricey but I guess that is what you should expect at the Ritz or any other five star resort. This and the 4 Seasons are the only 2 Five Star resorts on Maui.

I was a bit worried about the \"overcast & rain\" that many people have mentioned, but we luckily didn't have any less-than-perfect weather. This resort is beautiful, quiet, and first class all the way. Exactly what I expected from the name. The grounds are perfectly maintained , the fitness center is well-equipped, and the rooms were very comfortable. I got the best massage I have ever had & I also loved the steam room at the spa. There is DT Fleming beach that you can walk to from the pool area down the hillside. It is secluded and not crowded at all. You can also take a longer walk (or the shuttle) to Kapalua Bay for a busier beach & great snorkeling. We did both snorkeling & scuba diving at Kapalua Bay & there were plenty of turtles & other sea creatures to entertain us. We ate at Kai in the hotel, but found Sansei right down the road to be much better for sushi. We had remarkable beach front dinners in Kaanapali & Lahaina at Leilani's & Pacific 'O. Great food at Roy's too, (although there is no view here), and of course, Mama's Fish House in Paia. Mama's has THE best views of anywhere on the island, it is really spectacular! It's a great place to go for lunch rather than dinner, as there isn't a sunset view. We went on our last day in Maui on our way to the airport. We also did some awesome scuba diving with Lahaina Divers & thought they were great. We dove Lanai & had an awesome experience. Also did a Trilogy catamaran scuba trip to Molokini Crater & had a great time. I would also recommend that if you are going to rent a car, use the \"name your price\" option on priceline.com! I did a low-ball bid of $23/day for a convertible & got that price :) The only thing I didn't love about the Ritz was the layout of the buildings. The resort is built on an angle into the cliff side and is a little confusing to navigate due to the incline. For example, what is the 4th floor on one end of the building is the 1st floor on the other end. Just takes some getting used to, but I'll admit I got lost more than a few times ;) I would certainly stay at the Ritz Kapalua again, it was really spectacular overall.

The fridge and the microwave are a nice added bonus. This was our first visit to New York and the location of the subways and the buses were a nice feature. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We stayed in a room with a double bed and a shared bath. Was not to sure about the shared bath but I think that we were the only ones that used the bathroom. It was always clean and stocked. We stayed on the third floor and had no view other than the other buildings but we were not in the room much and didn't care about the view because we were always out and about in the city. The lift always seemed to be mentioned a lot in the other reviews but we had no issues with it at all. Out wait times were releatively short and the hotel was very busy the whole seven days that we were there. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone who is a first time visitor and wants to keep the cost down. My wife and I were very impressed. Also if you have special requests be sure and e-mail them. My wife has knee problems and we requested a stay on the lowest floor possible and even though we did not book the room thru the hotel (AARP Expedia) our request was acknowledged.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Value":4,"Rooms":4,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-09-18 07:50:00 +0300","author":"Faye Olson"},{"content":"For the past few years I had been staying at their partner hotel 20 blocks south on Broadway.

Honolulu is just loaded with cheap hotel rooms but your mileage can vary A LOT! Last trip over I had stayed at the Park Shore, but I took a chance on the lower internet rate at the Ambassador, scared of what I might find! I was pleasantly surprised. The internet rate lands you a room on the lower three floors, and while I was a little concerned with street noise, the window coverings were very adequate, and noise was not an issue. As other reviews have stated, this is an older building, and there is nothing about it that is vacation-like. It is: A hotel. What was so nice was the cleanliness that was maintained along with a larger room; Perfect for a business trip like I was on. The staff was more than jovial and helpful. The parking was $9/day, reasonable for Waikiki. As always I suggest, if renting a car, get the smallest one available: Waikiki parking spots are tiny by mainland standards. The location of this property is close enough to the action if you want that, and yet near to the park at Fort Durussey (sp) and the elegance at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. One other nice little detail: if you wanted to go to the Hard Rock, it's easy walking distance. Same with the Convention Center. There are essentially no on-site amenities with the exception of the pool, small, but again, very nice and clean. As a business traveler I am extremely keen on clean and water pressure in the shower. Both of these expectations were met, and very nicely I might add. I'm sure this is why this older budget hotel receives three stars on the web and not 2 1/2 or less. By the way their little shampoo bottles? I loved their brand! If you need breakfast, you can walk around the corner to the (attached) Thai Restaurant which serves a budget breakfast with open air dining. If you need good Kona Coffee and pastry, there is a shop just outside the door, and if you forgot toiletries, there is an ABC store attached - of course there is one ABC store for every three tourists in Waikik. There is also a TGIF just accross the street at the Ohana Maile Sky Court. I can recomend this hotel for anyone who gets ill over paying $150 or more a night for a hotel while on vacation. It is a very well maintained property.  If this is a once in a lifetime vacation I would say two things: number one, skip Ohau and get yourself over to the other islands (Kauai is my favorite) and number two: if you are making Waikiki your destination and want a memorable Hotel experience, bite the bullet and pay for the Hilton Hawaiian Village or Halekulani experience. Remember: Honolulu is a very large metropolis with nearly a million people. Those other two properties I mention will isolate you from the big city feel and of Waikiki and all that goes along with it, quite nicely.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Business service":-1,"Check in / front desk":-1},"date":"2012-06-13 14:40:31 +0300","author":"Ewald Lang"},{"content":"Worst place we ever stayed at Our hotel room at the Ambassador was shabby and run-down. The paint was peeling off the walls, the carpet was filthy, only a small bare light bulb over the sink in the bathroom. The TV did not work - all stations were nothing but snow. There was one station that one could see if you could see through the snow and the wavy white lines. We told the front office people twice about this and both times they promised that it would be fixed but it never was. Our wakeup call each morning was at 5 a.m. with the noise of delivery trucks, slamming of doors, and the annoying beep, beep, beep sound that trucks make when they back up. Just as we were about to go back to sleep, it would start all over again. We asked to be moved to an other room but they would not accomodate us. This was the worst place we have ever stayed at. We also had trouble with the parking key they gave us to get out of the parking lot - the one you insert that lifts the gate handle up. This happened three times that the gates would not open. We had to push the assistance buzzer. The third time it happened my husband pushed the assistance buzzer but no one would respond. I finally went inside the hotel where there were 4 people behind the desk but not one of them paid any attention to when we pushed the button for help.","ratings":{"Overall":1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1,"Rooms":-1,"Location":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Business service":-1,"Check in / front desk":-1},"date":"2013-10-27 12:50:08 +0300","author":"Juwan Krajcik"},{"content":"Great hotel  My husband and I were married in Hawaii and chose this hotel for its location  price (which actually seemed a little TOO cheap to us -- was $110 per night at the time).

We also easily could walk to restaurants and went to the Highway 86 jazz bar located about a block away. The Four Seasons service was impeccable. Our room service was great and right on time. We at lunch in the Lounge and our meal was very good. I used the gym and our daughter swam in the pool. Both we very clean and more than adequate for this size hotel. The pool is located outdoors, however heated to about 80 degrees. Our daughter had no problem swimming in it the 50 degree misting weather!

I would recommend the hotel to other travelers. The hotel is a new structure, of modest height, right on Seattleâ€™s waterfront. A few of the rooms have direct waterfront views. Many other rooms (mine included) overlook the pool area and have diagonal views of the water. There are also rooms which look out over the streets that surround the hotel (I thiink I'd try to avoid those). The interior dÃ©cor is modern (think bleached wood, and Scandinavian design). The standard rooms are of decent size, and include a built in desk with two chairs (one a high tech swivel chair with mesh back and seat) and one easy chair. The easy chair suffers (just a little) from the modern design problem â€“ i.e., itâ€™s beautiful to look at but nowhere near as comfortable as a traditional overstuffed arm chair. The room was perfectly quiet during my stay (no noise from adjoining rooms, nor any detectable noise from the outside). The lighting in the room is good â€“ each of the reading locations has a light source of more than ample wattage. All of the linens and bedding were of the normal high Four Seasons quality. The service was excellent. All my interactions with the front desk were handled precisely and efficiently. The concierge offered a dinner recommendation, and followed up with an inquiry about the meal. The one breakfast I ate in the restaurant was very good. This hotel lacks some of the charm and history that the Olympic Hotel provided when it was managed by Four Seasons. That said, this is a very fine hotel, and one I would be glad to visit again.","ratings":{"Overall":5},"date":"2015-06-08 07:57:37 +0300","author":"Delbert Borer"},{"content":"I am a loyal Four Seasons customer and was very excited to have the chain come back to Seattle after many years of absence. Unfortunately, my first stay negated my excitement. The hotel is new and the rooms are reasonably nice and brand new, but not really up to Four Seasons standards. The furniture is light maple and the carpets are very bright. The entire place felt like it was built by high end Ikea. It doesn't look or feel luxurious. The other big problem is the location and the view. I paid extra for a waterview room, but it was dominated by a view of two big smokestacks and a construction site. Seattle has amazing water views but this hotel isn't situated in a spot that has them. In fact, it is still in a transitional neighborhood with a handful of peep shows and X rates theaters only a block away. The worst part of my stay, however, was my inability to take a normal shower. The water pressure in the shower was the lowest I've experienced in North America. I couldn't wash my hair and could barely get the soap off my body. Upon checkout I emailed the manager and he told me that the \"water pressure in my room was consistent with the hotel standard.\" I don't know what that means but it is not connsistent with any other place and certainly not a Four Seasons. Seattle has great luxury hotel choices in Hotel 1000 and the new Pan Pacific. There is no reason at all to put up with the shortcomings of this Four Seasons.","ratings":{"Overall":1,"Service":3,"Value":1,"Rooms":2,"Location":2,"Cleanliness":4},"date":"2015-04-05 15:20:29 +0300","author":"Jakob Runte"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-117.16779,"lat":32.71598},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":null,"vacancy":true,"free_parking":true,"price":"Dorms from $44 per night","address":"500 West Broadway","description":"YMCA-affiliated Hostel in downtown San Diego, right next to Amtrak railway station.

Once we parked and saw the somehwhat \"sketchy\" area, we asked for rooms in the Tower instead. This was no problem and we got 4 (out of the 5 we needed) of our rooms together on the 9th floor. All were large, clean and had a far off Strip view! There was a cute little loveseat with a coffee table, a nice desk, a huge dresser and adorable iron-work lamps. I think the decor was maybe a \"Cuban\" theme. Beds were simple, nice linens, lots of pillows and very comfy. Old TV. Coffee maker! My only complaint would be the pretty small bathroom and closet off to the side. Shower was good with lots of pressure and hot water. Ok toiletries. Safe did not work. Casino here is small but with lower gaming tables. Spent hours at the $1 roulette table! Awesome amazing steakhouse here too, called the Flame. A must try!

When I travel domestically I try to stay in Hilton or Embassy Suite properties as they tend to be convenient for meetings. Check In: We arrived mid day, before check in time. We were attended to quickly, and I suppose since I am the person with higher priority I was given a room and the other two in my party had to wait. That is too be expected in convention time, and they were polite and organized about it. What I did not like was that one of my people was put in a different type of room, a non suite (which I did not know Embassy Suites had) and the rate was the same. The clerk knew this was a bad deal and could not look us in the eyes, mumbled she was sorry and dismissed us. When i got to my room I found either it was a smoking room or someone smoked there, and since the hotel was full, that was that. I have significant alergies to smoke so that is an issue, I had made our reservations 5 months ahead of time just to make sure that we got non-smoking rooms. Dining Room: We did have a few meals in the restaurant. Food was good, and the service very polite, but painfully slow. Manager's Cocktail party. A little above average in terms of the snacks etc. It is a large area for the event so there is plenty of comfortable seating. Definately a high point :-) Breakfast The buffet line was organized and moved well. Typical Embassy Suites breakfast, which is a selling point for the restaurant. Gym This is a little gem in the hotel with enough room and machines to accomodate the crowd. Very well done and maintained, another high point. Overall property condition The property, being very close to the convention center (it is two blocks away), gets alot of hard use I am sure, and it shows. It is a well worn property, generally clean. My room had a newer flat screen TV in both room, the carpet, and furnishings were tired. And the smoke smell (see previous comment). Staff I was impressed with the staff here in general. They were friendly to a fault, and smiling. Someone has trained them up on customer service, little things like taking you to where you were asking about, instead of pointing and saying \"its over there\" is pretty rare these days. Kudos to the GM or person in charge of training. Overall the staff, the manager's reception, and breakfast slightly overweigh the condition of the place, so we will most likely return. Would be nice to see this property get a facelift though. There are alot of nice hotels close....","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":4,"Value":3,"Rooms":2,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":3,"Sleep Quality":2},"date":"2013-10-04 08:48:42 +0300","author":"Jack Crona"},{"content":"3 of us went to New Orleans for a conference at the Convention Center.

You can get the street car (tram) from River Walk or from Julia Road to the French Quarter or the Garden district or wherever. Both stops are within walking distance from the hotel. There was a small balcony off the bedroom. The front door faced the inner courtyard of the hotel which was very nicely decorated. Cons: The sleeper couch in the room was not very comfortable. Sunday night it was extremely noisy outside the hotel. Sounded like cars racing around.

The room was a perfect size for us. We had some special requests to accommodate friends joining us and the front desk staff could not have been nice or more helpful. The valet staff was great, even when parades were blocking street and tempers could have been short. Our room overlooked the atrium, which could get noisy, but our room was quite soundproof.

We were treated like VIP's from the moment we arrived right up to the time we left. The staff goes the extra mile to ensure your happiness. We requested the early check-in (granted). We asked to be placed as close to the top as possible (15th floor) and when I was told that there would be a cost for the internet and playfully complained, it was given to us free. Yeah, the rooms are smaller than the average ES but the hotel was not built for ES. Our room had that mold smell so we opened our front door and the patio door and after a few minutes it was fine. The breakfast was great (although they do not have shrimp at the omelet station) with lots of options. I thought the location was perfect, close enough to walk to the Quarter but far enough away from the noise (it's about a 10 down, 15 back after a few adult beverages). The Riverwalk Mall is about 5 minutes away.

It is in a rather quiet and upcoming part of downtown called the Warehouse/Arts District. I experienced two extremes regarding service. On one hand, the porters and bellhops were excelent and nice. Some people at the reception desk were not as nice. The bartender was rude. During the \"Manager's Reception\" there were two people in line (one was I) and three bartenders. I moved over to the bar and sat on a stool as to suggest that another bartender could help me. Instead, the bartender had me go back on the line and two more people had taken my spot. The bartender noticed but said nothing to them. That was rude. He was so slow serving that I just left the line instead of waiting. I guess the instructions are to take their time with the \"Manager's Reception Customers\" so that not much is consumed. On the brighter side, breakfast was great ad the rooms were big and spacious. The coffee served was not best quality, but...The hotel is set up like a motel and the room doors look to the outside. This can be a problem when it is cold outside. My suite's door was old and rusty and the shower/ bath faucet connection were faulty. I did not report this as the water still flowed. There are no in-room safes and that is a drag. There are other more expensive amenities in the room, but having safes should be good. The place could also take a little better maintenance.

It is convenient to restaurants, stores and attractions. It is 2-3 blocks from Canal Street. The hotel is going through a huge transformation in the lobby so wonder if the rooms will also be updated. The sleeping rooms are simple and fairly small. But it served it's purpose - I have a desk to work and a bed to sleep in. I do have to complain about the bathroom. There is really no place to place your toiletries. The hotel does have a restaurant but cannot comment on it because all I ever got in there was coffee.

The ONLY bright spot was the bellhop, Ray. He was great and very friendly! The people at the front desk hardly said a word to us when we arrived. They seemed awfully smug and acted like we were bothering them when we came in each time. The hotel room was OK - just OK - but the bathroom had serious issues. Our toilet leaked the whole time, so we had a constant pool of water on the floor. gross. The wallpaper in the bathroom was curling up and there was a weird mold patch on the ceiling that had a hole in the middle of the patch. It seriously looked like there was a hidden camera in there or something. I don't normally have allergies but I had 2 different allergy attacks while showering because of the mold. They also gave us fewer towels each day, so by the last night, we didn't have hand towels. I asked for more and they assured me they'd send more. They never did. We were using a few towels each day to soak up the water from the toilet, so we needed more and we didn't get more. The shower curtain was too short for the tub and even more water leaked onto the floor during every shower. We got TWO tiny pillows for our bed - which was only a queen sized bed. I thought I reserved a King. The room was small and humid and the only way to sleep and not hear neighbors next door was to leave our A/C fan running the whole night. We read another review that said to take a different elevator that was to the left when you leave the lobby. Glad we did. The other one was horribly slow. I would not return here again when there are so many other choices of hotels in NOLA. The Sheraton has had my business in the past and will again next time. I would say, \"You get what you pay for\" but the rate was 4 times the regular rate, so I expected at least more than 2 pillows and enough towels for just the two of us. Totally disappointed. :(","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":2,"Value":1,"Rooms":2,"Location":3,"Cleanliness":2,"Sleep Quality":1},"date":"2014-05-10 12:02:44 +0300","author":"Rashad Reinger"},{"content":"I have been staying at the Parc St. Charles on business for the last two months...usually one night a week.

I was overcharged for my stay, valet takes forever to get your vehicle to you no matter how far in advance you request it. The place was roach infested and they didn't seem to care when I brought it to their attention. I was charged a $150 fee because they claimed we smoked in our room when in fact we DO NOT smoke. They said there was evidence of smoking in the room (prior to check-out) but the fact is, no one should have even been in our room before our check-out because of the DO NOT DISTURB sign on our door. When I asked to speak with the person who was in our room without my permission, they could not produce anyone who spoke English. The elevator is extremely slow and the AC is set at about 80 degrees in the lobby. The AC in the room could not be set below 75. There is ice available on floors 3 5 and 9 but you have to know how to find it yourself. Vending is only on the 5th floor. The rooms are the size of a large walk-in closet.

As previously stated by others, the staff were friendly, professional, helpful, and knowledgable about New Orleans. We arrived early (9:30a.m.) and checked in. A room was not ready, so Bryan, a super nice and cheerful bellhop, securely stored our luggage while we set out to wander the Quarter. We returned around 2:30p.m. and retired to our room for a rest from a lot of walking. The room was a standard room with a king bed which was quite comfortable. Our view was of the building next door. I imagine that is basically the view from any room due to the location among other high rise buildings. Yes, the furniture did show some signs of wear with a few dings and dents. However, it was nothing monumental. We enjoyed having a flat screen TV, a microwave and a refrigerator in the room. The bathtub surround showed some age and discoloration; but again, truly nothing worth complaining about. The breakfast offerings were quite good and had a multitude of choices; eggs, sausage, gravy, fruit, yogurt, cereal, etc.. The afternoon cookies were a nice treat also.

The price also includes microwaves, refrigerators, wifi, and a huge spread for breakfast in the morning - eggs, meat, biscuits, waffle makers, fruit, cereals, breads, etc. The location is awesome too - 2 blocks from Bourbon St. without being in the middle of the craziness! I did have some trouble with the staff. My luggage was lost and I didn't get to the hotel until 11pm - without luggage. The sign in the room says to come to the front desk for a replacement of any toiletries you forgot. So, I went to the desk for some basic necessities. The guy actually laughed at me and said \"why would we have those? There is a CVS down the block.\" Ummmm, ok, thanks, you have a sign that indicates otherwise... The next morning I needed to make a business call and my cell phone only had 2 bars of reception. I called the front desk to ask about the long distance rates. The response I received (after trying to call twice) was \"I have no idea.\" On the last day, I called down to see if I could extend my check out - I called SIX times before someone picked up. Also, no one told me I needed a key to get into the front door after 11pm (or where to insert it) so I stood there bewildered one night until I found the hidden slot to put my key in.... Anyway, the hotel itself is great and I would definitely go back, especially since I rarely need the hotel staff, this time was an exception. Also, I think they are short/poorly staffed because when I was waiting for a taxi, there were at least 6 people around me in the waiting area filling out job applications...

There were several lifts which were quick and also required your door key to operate. We had good nights sleep and did not hear any street noise whatsoever. This was one of the main reasons why we chose to stay outside the French Quarter. The room was very spacious it included flat screen TV, room safe, in room free wifi, A/C unit. The bathroom was fine, but a bit dated. The breakfast which is included in your room rate was better than expected. It included cereals, eggs, bacon, bread, bagels etc. It was constantly replenished whilst we were there. We walked everywhere from the hotel, the French quarter is just on the other side of canal street, The world war 2 & ogden museum are only about 10 - 15 minutes, and the aquarium is also close. We had a great time in New Orleans the New Years eve fireworks were good. The city was even better than we expected, we only have fond memories and would love to go back at some stage in the future. Not only does the city have some outstanding sights to see but the food is also very good.

The breakfast area is located in the 4th floor dining area as well a computer and large screen TV. The hotel also has free wi fi throughout the hotel. Breakfast is the typical Hampton Buffet Breakfast. There is a gym on this floor also but I did not use it. Parking is costly, we did not rent a car. We took a cab which is $33.00 flat rate to the city(plus tip). Cabs are plentiful in front of the hotel if you need a ride to the airport. I think there is a Shuttle for $20.00 per person from airport, since there were two of us, it was cheaper to use a cab. Hotel is located 2 blocks from Canal Street..cross it and you are at the beginning of the French Quarter. There is a CVS on the corner to pick up odds and ends.

Initially, it was unclear where the elevators were so I ended up heading to the elevators in the office building and told by someone that I was going the wrong way. You have to use your room key to access all floors, except the lobby, which can be a little annoying. The lobby area and the elevators are a little seedy. Definitely not up to the standards of other Hampton Inn hotels The room is also very small compared to other Hampton Inn hotels. I stayed in a room with a king sized bed and the bathroom is one of the smallest I have seen. It contained a stand up shower (and no bathtub) There was no spacious closet like I'm used to. The TV, closet space, and bureau were all part of one big armoire in the room. I called to schedule a wake up call at 6:30am, which I never received. Then I asked the front desk to call a cab for me. I allowed myself plenty of time. However, even when I got downstairs, I still had to wait for an additional 20 minutes, almost arriving late to my morning meeting.

I was very excited to stay on the second floor this time (I didn't even notice the stairs last time) and when I opened the door I was pleasantly surprised to see two very adorable beds that had the four poster feel to them (with two posts instead at the head) and though there was no window because of where we were in the building it was still nice. Could have done with another light as we only had one table lamp in the corner but we just turned the bathroom light on. The breakfast the first morning was about 3 hours late, but It's just breakfast. The other days it was on time and great. The people at the desk were helpful and kind and the workers as well always said hello.

I called to many other hotels hoping that this would be the cheapest and not booked and it was! I was so excited. The tv was also not working most of the time, but we were on vacation so we didn't need it much at all. There are many nice places to eat and souvenir shops close by to visit. You can catch the streetcar and sit on the wharf next to the river as well with a 5-10 minute walk. Its great. And don't forget to swim in the pool before you leave.

You really cannot get a better location in the French Quarter that is convenient to all of the major attractions and the Frenchman St. Marigny clubs as well; you can easily walk to every club you want to go to. I was on a trip home to visit family and chose this hotel to stay at for my visit. The room I had was typical for a hotel of that age in the FQ as far as size goes; in other words my room was not spacious, but again, rooms in any other FQ hotel of the same age are not spacious either. If you want a large room stay in one of the tower monstrosities that have sprung up on Canal St. in the past 20 years. But why would you want to stay at one of those, you can stay at one of those in your own home town, so if that is what you prefer stay home. One of the things I like about the hotel is the scale of it. It's only two stories tall, so no elevator, one can move around in the hotel very easily. One flight of stairs and you are on the street, or in the pool, no long walks. I once stayed at the Bellagio in Las Vegas and hated it because it took at least 20 mins to get from my room to the street. A hotel can be too large. The room was clean and had a nice shower, no tub, but I do not use a tub and was glad that I did not have to step into a tub to take a shower. The TV was on the small side, with a minimum of channels, but I wasn't on vacation to watch TV. Breakfast was served every morning along with a copy of the Times-Picayune. I took my breakfast downstairs in the patio, the coffee was very good. The continental breakfast is nothing to rave about, but I have yet to have a continental breakfast in a U.S. hotel that is worth raving about, in that regard the Europeans are way ahead. But really, who cares, if you want breakfast you are in the FQ, just walk down the street, there are plenty of restaurants around. The best quality about the hotel is the staff. If you come to New Orleans remember this, people here will talk to you; its the norm, and if you speak to them you will get to know them and that makes all the difference in the world when staying in a small hotel where you will see the same staff day after day. Remember this too, nothing says hello like money. When you are served breakfast give a tip, when you go out leave a tip for the maid cleaning the room. Tipping is part of the culture in New Orleans; we tip everyone, and everyone expects a tip, and people will respond in kind. In New Orleans it is customary to give someone a little something extra, we even have our own word for it; lagniappe. I was traveling alone on my visit home, I left $2 for the maid, and $2 for breakfast everyday, that's $4 a day, not much at all, but it makes a difference to the staff. It also makes a difference to say \"good morning\" or respond in kind when someone says it to you. Treat the staff as your peers and with courtesy and you will have a pleasant stay I promise you. Parking: the hotel has offsite valet parking. I never used it because I flew into New Orleans and did not rent a car. No need for a car if one is staying in the FQ. But for those who drive to New Orleans or rent a car all I can tell you is that during my stay at the hotel I never heard anyone complain about waiting for their car to arrive once it was summoned. The bottom line is this, would I stay at this hotel again; yes. There are only four hotels in the FQ that I will stay in, and this is one of the four.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2013-03-07 18:47:48 +0300","author":"Alverta Mueller"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lon":-117.15944,"lat":32.7159},"free_breakfast":false,"email":null,"phone":"+1 619 446-3000","vacancy":false,"free_parking":false,"price":"$169-249","address":"530 Broadway","description":"A unique 245-room hotel where timeless charm is blended seamlessly with sophisticated comfort of modern guest accommodations.

I was very excited when I booked this place because it seemed like a great location and cute and cozy. NONE OF THE ABOVE! I rented the suite up at the top. It's the one when you go all the way up the stairs to the left. Don't get me wrong I understand these places are old but this was way too much.. When we got up to our room there was cobwebs all over. The smell inside smelled like burnt flesh if that is even a smell. I had to call them 3 times to come and see about the smell because it was THAT bad. They had to put \"air\" cleaners in the room. They had 3 hooked up. They said we could keep them the entire weekend if we wanted, because that is a relaxing vacation. The air didn't work, it was HOT AND STICKY. The bathroom was DISGUSTING. There was hair all over the counter and the towels were stained and nasty. Let me go to the bed. It STUNK so bad that I refused to lay in it. I was actually scared that the sheets were not even clean. LONG story short, I was planning on staying here for 3 days and after 5 hours there I checked out and went to the HILTON, where I had a clean room and NICE people. BTW, did I mention that when I explained to the lady that I wanted to check out because of all these reasons she REFUSED and said I was LYING. I still had to pay 300 dollars because she said now they wont have a chance of getting anyone in the room and I caused them to LOOSE money.

If you don't want a cookie cutter hotel this is for you. It takes you back to old New Orleans. The room is decorated in the New Orleans theme. The beds are small doubles. It seems strange at first but gets you in the mood to experience New Orleans as it should be. The room was on the second floor that opened onto a small balcony. A patio is below. It was shrouded in fog when we were there. We never went outside that our glasses didn't fog up. The doors lock with a key. This hotel is about 150 years old. It was abandoned in the 50's and remodeled in 1959. The staff was friendly and the french market and bourbon street were close. We were there when the Saints won their first game of the season and we expected a lot of party noise. We heard a little, but not much. The room is very small, especially for four women with a lot of luggage. Continental Breakfast is limited to muffins, coffee and juice, served by a waitress on the patio. There is a parking fee.

Reserved a two room suite for $450 a night. One room was downstairs and the other was a loft bedroom with a bathroom. Very large in size and spacious. Kitchen has refrigerator and microwave oven. Stove was not working and we were told they don't want people cooking in the room. Suite was right across the street from an irish pub. The pub had music blaring straight into our suite until 4-5am every morning. Needless to say we got no sleep. In addition, the buggies with horses carrying people trot by nonstop throughout the day and night. One of the drivers told us that this building was the first morgue in New Orleans. The floors were extremely dirty. We wore socks and they were black after five minutes walking around. The amenities were not what you would expect when paying $450 a night. The toilet paper and tissue were like sand paper. The towels were hard. The housekeeping staff didn't show up until we called. Even then we were told that they were too busy doing check outs and couldn't come until after 4pm. The contitnental breakfast that was included wasn't too great either. It's a bread item and orange juice. The danish tasted stale. The pool looks inviting but is not heated. My family froze in the pool. It's close to things in the quarter but it's extremely noisy all night long and not clean. I don't recommend this one.","ratings":{"Overall":1},"date":"2013-09-05 07:38:56 +0300","author":"Regan Ondricka"},{"content":"This is a pretty nice hotel.

The concierge was very friendly and helpful. We did have to call down for fresh towels one day (being a time share they don't clean your room or refresh yoru towels) and the first lady at the front desk didn't seem interested in helping us so we called back an hour later and the gentleman that answered was very helpful and even called up an hour later to make sure we got our towels. The location is very nice. The St. Charles line stops right out front and it is about 2 miles from the French Quarter and even closer to the Garden District. We did try to get a late check out (noon vs. 10am) and was informed by the front desk that they do not do late checkouts on Fridays.

Nearly everything from the time we arrived to the time we checked out was absolutely perfect! The entire staff was helpful and courteous, the room was clean and just as it was described online, and the balcony was the perfect location for watching the parades away from the chaos of street level. The only issue we had (and it really wasn't a huge deal) was that the resort does not have as many parking spaces as it does rooms. Since they were completely booked due to the holiday, by the time we arrived, we were not able to valet our car. Fortunately, there are ample places in the area to park. With the resort being directly on the parade routes, we were slightly concerened about the crowds on the balcony or courtyard areas. They do a good job of controlling that though with each guest being required to wear a colored wrist band (each day was a different color). Registered guests' bracelets are included in the price of the room and our visitors were able to purchase bracelets for $20 per day. This kept the crowds within the property at a reasonable level. The layout of the room was nice (studio suite) with the kitchen on one side, restroom on the other, a dining area near the large window, and a seperate space for storing luggage. We opted for two queen beds since our friends were staying with us and did not feel crowded at all. I had broken my ankle the night before our stay so was confined to a wheelchair and crutches for the duration. The staff was VERY helpful, opening doors for us, holding elevators, making sure everything was just right. The courtyard by the guest lounge is a great, quiet place to sit and enjoy coffee in the morning. I really just can't say enough positive things about this place! We will definitely be back again.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2015-12-15 12:50:16 +0300","author":"Madie Goyette"},{"content":"We stayed here for a destination wedding 2 weeks ago.

We had plenty of space for the 2 of us, they did offer us an upgrade to a 1 bed/bath for an extra 100/day, but seeing that is more of a hike than their original ticket price, we decided the studio was the perfect fit. We overlooked Whaler's village, but also had a view of the ocean and mountains and the perfect sunsets (the same view all units have). We stopped at k-mart by the airport and got breakfast and lunch food and went out for dinner each night.

I sent the guest manager, Sean an email a month prior to our trip to let him know this was our first trip with a Starwood Property and that we were very excited to celebrate my birthday and our anniversary during this trip. Upon arrival, we were greeted by several valet attendants who all welcomed us with huge smiles and helped us with the kids and our bags. At check in, I was excited to learn we had been upgraded to an Ocean View room by Sean. Will brought our bags up to our room and gave us a quick yet detailed run down of the property and what to do and how to get there. Our room was fantastic! Great view of the ocean, the pools and the whales every morning! We went out for dinner shortly after for less than two hours and returned to find a delicious cake and a bottle of champagne waiting for us!!! Thanks Westin! That was the best birthday I had ever had, HANDS DOWN! And that was just the first night. We enjoyed some relaxation time in the pools with the kids the first night after a long day of flying. The second day, we retrieved our vehicle from valet and the attendants told us some Road to Hana tips and even loaned us a CD with a guided tour to help us on the trip. Each and every hotel employee that we came in contact with had a smile on their face and made us feel like we were at home and were the most important person on property. The people who claim everyone was rude or unconcerned with them, I can only think that you get what you receive. Smile at someone, and someone will smile back. On occasion, the line at the front desk was long and the process seemed a bit tedious. If you want something quicker, check and see if you can find a Holiday Inn near by and go there if that's the biggest concern you have. YOU ARE ON VACATION. IN HAWAII. RELAX. The rooms are great, the beds somewhat heavenly, I am pretty picky when it comes to beds and I slept like a baby on them. The rooms were quiet, which is a huge deal for me as I am a light sleeper. The fridge was a great plus to have in the room to keep drinks cold, and a few snacks on hand with the kids. My brother in law even got a microwave in his room to warm food and formula up for their daughter. I was never concerned with anyone jumping on to my patio to break into my room, not from the 9th floor, and I wouldn't have from the 2nd floor either. The sliding glass door has two very suitable locks. Use them if you feel it necessary. The only problem I had with the property involved the internet. I never EVER leave my credit card on file with a hotel after a HORRIBLE problem with another property that you can read about in my other reviews. For some odd reason, not having a card on file prevents you from accessing the free wi-fi that comes with the resort fee. This boggles my mind, because my resort fee had been paid for, why does that not cover my wi-fi? It also covers parking and not having a card on file didn't effect this. I think that is something Westin needs to work out to ensure a better hotel experience. On one occasion, we also didn't get housekeeping while we were out, we left later in the day when they came by I am sure and a quick call to the front desk had it taken care of upon our arrival while we were at dinner. I also think there should be some double checking by housekeeping for rooms that don't get cleaned in the morning because not everyone gets up and our by 10 or 11 AM. Other than those two issues, and the fact that the parking spots are very tight and people don't know how to park in between the lines, this place is spectacular! The staff is wonderful, in fact I have never been to a hotel with a more friendly staff. There is golf right across the way, several amazing restaurants with great seafood. If you need any tips on anything, just ask the valet guys. They know everything! We even left some beach toys we purchased at their stand so if you need them, go borrow them and return them for the next kids!!!!","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2015-09-10 23:30:49 +0300","author":"Hazle Miller II"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lon":-119.3254,"lat":38.2389},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1-760-932-7070","vacancy":false,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":"Toiyabe National Forest, Bridgeport","description":"Hiking trails, hot springs, firewood, toilets.

The front desk has games for you to check out and a great reck room to watch TV and play them in. Great location for the street car, right outside the resort, to get into the French Quarter.

The trolley car runs right by and it only takes a few steps to the stop. Magazine street, where all the cute shops and boutiques are only four blocks away. A great breakfast place, the \"Trolley Stop Cafe\" is two blocks away (towards the Quarter). There is also a great bar on the same block named \"Igors\" that is open 24 hours a day, full of locals who are very polite and talkative. Drinks are cheap and you can do your laundry there, while eating their tasty chicken nuggets while you talk to a local about the best night clubs in town. Here are some great guidlines that we learned in Orleans: Monday: We got to Orleans on a Tuesday, so no help here. Go to Igors and ask local. Tuesday: The Rebirth Brass Band at Maple Leaf. About a 15 minute trolley ride from the hotel. All the locals go here. Wednesday: Head to Toniques on Rampart and St. Ann and ask for a \"Frenchman's Dark and Stormy. Hang out here for a while, then hit up Fat Cats on Bourbon, great funk/ soul band named \"Connections\". Very mature crowd (25-60 years old). Thursdays: Go to Tropical Island on St. Peters and Bourbon, grab a Hand Grenade. Find a great band and just hang out. Fat Cats is always a can't miss with the band. Friday: Hit up at Pat O'Brien's just past Bourbon St. and St. Peters. Grab a Hurricane. You can either ask for a plastic cup or get the gigantic Hurricane glass cup that will cost $3 extra. The glass cup is a great souvenir. Sit down and eat dinner. Try the gator strips. Ask for \"Frank\", the Sous Chef at Pat O's. He is a great guy who will give you great pointers. Tell him Josue and Ian still think it is his fault. If you want hip hop and club stuff stay on Bourbon. If you want great music, head to Frenchman st, where the locals hang. Keep reading. Saturday: Head to Frenchman Street, Just a 5 minute walk from Bourbon Street, just off of Esplanade Street. The Soul Rebel Brass Band plays at Blue Nile. They are great! A reggae band plays a block away. And at Snug Harbor you can catch the best Jazz musicians in New Orleans. After you get out of the clubs head a block up for Burritos. Swayze thought the green hot sauce was \"pretty good\". Then head back to the Quarter, knock on Brad Pitts door, then head to Cafe Du Mond for some hangover food... Coffee and Benites . Sunday: Recovery.... Head to the Trolley Stop Cafe down from the hotel, have a good breakfast. Then head back to Bourbon and head to Lafitte's Blacksmith Bar, Oldest bar in the U.S. Grab a seat, chill, and make a playlist on the juke box. For lunch head to Port a Call on Espandele St, few minutes from the Black Smith. Eat at the Bar and enjoy that burger. Finish up at Tonique with a Dark and Stormy. Hope this helps.

We stayed in a one-bedroom suite which was sorely in need of some work. Paint was peeling, walls were scuffed, some lights worked, some didn't, the remote controls worked only sometimes. The bathroom was the worst, hardly any room to put cosmetics or anything else. The service here isn't fabulous. Several times we asked the evening clerk for directions, to which she responded somewhat nastily, \"Why would you want to go there?\" When we actually made it to 'there' (Magazine Street) we were thankful that we didn't take her advice to just stay in our little corner of the Garden District. By the way, Magazine Street has wonderful, wonderful little stores, cafes, and galleries. Definatly worth the trip. Also, we were two couples sharing a room. Every day we'd have to call down to get a 4th set of towels as EVERY day they would leave us only 3 even though we kept telling them we would need 4 sets everyday and asked them to note it in housekeeping. This is a mild inconvenience, but annoying to have to keep calling. The location is great, close enough to the French Quarter via Trolley to enjoy the action there, but far enough away to have some peace and quiet when you needed it. It goes without saying that the Garden District is lovely. We spent at least two days strolling around looking at the architecture. Overall, this place is fine to stay at, but nothing fabulous. The kitchen is nice if you aren't interested in always eating out. However, if this was where I owned Timeshare, I'd be very upset at how they are keeping up the property.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":2,"Value":4,"Rooms":2,"Cleanliness":3},"date":"2015-02-25 15:35:37 +0300","author":"Loraine Walter"},{"content":"Some friends and I stayed at this hotel from 7/31-8/3 and it was the absolute worst.

The tub backed up while showering so you actually were standing in this dirty water while rushing to shower to get out of there. This \"so-called\" maintenance man came and pulled all the gunk out of the drain with his bare hands whic was totally gross and as a consequence, 2 of us caught Athlete's Foot!

This place was once used for a movie setting back in the 70's and has been trying to live off that reputation. That is also the last time the place was renovated. It was supposed to look like a cheap bordello and it still looks that way. If old and dumpy mean charming, then that describes this place. It's also known by locals for it's happy hour but it's mainly for college students and groups of middle age housewives. The bar could be really nice if someone there could actually make a classic cocktail. The bar and lounge area are sticky and the upholstery is lumpy and seen better days. The bar is loud late into the evening and the noise echos throughout the hotel. Considering the price, you could go online and get a room at one of the luxury hotels downtown. There's plenty of faded elegance in this town, this place is just plain old and retired. Never, ever ,pay more than $100 a night for this place.

It took me and my boyfriend three more shakes over what seemed like eternity but was more like an hour before the bed finally shook so hard, we jumped out grabbed a blanket and headed to the lobby, jamy's and all. Once we got down there, another enternity, the staff immediately knew we were staying on the third floor and the stories started coming. By the end nite or morning, I had called my parents at home and asked for them to pay for another hotel someplace else so I could sleep some place without a \"history\". I never went back into my room but did venture with a hotel maid back to the third floor to visit another room that had many sightings and hauntings.

This was our second trip to Istanbul (May 2010 was the first) but it was the first for our friend from Australia. We all agree we would go back. The location is excellent. Easy walking to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and the tram. The airport pickup was wonderful -- better than on our first visit when we stayed in a more up market place for twice the price. I don't know if it's the norm for the pickup but we had onboard video in our car and it was a good introduction to this fascinating city. The rooms are a little on the small side but to be expected in a converted traditional building. A room with 2 singles seemed to have a bit more room than the double room. Rooms facing the street are a little noisy but what would you expect in a city? And the noise does die down around midnight. The staff are very friendly, helpful and courteous. Nothing was too much trouble. We ate twice at their family owned restaurant around the corner, again, courteous, and friendly service, and good food. We received the discount without being asked - how did they know we were staying around the corner? There are other restaurants in easy walking distance which we found helpful after a day full of sight seeing. Breakfasts were enjoyable and there was always enough to choose from. Maybe not enough seating in the cooler months when everyone wants to sit inside at more or less the same time, but it was manageable, I suppose this wouldn't be a problem in the warmer months. We would definately stay here again if we are lucky enough to visit Istanbul again, it is an amazingly beautiful and diverse and friendly city.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2014-09-12 07:26:48 +0300","author":"Aiden Bednar"},{"content":"The hotel is conveniently located, the staff helpful, and the rates affordable ($50 / night for 1), however - however, the bed was uncomfortable, they changed which room I was in (and moved all my stuff) during the day while I was out sight-seeing, and the view from the roof was a bit disappointing (you do have a partial blue mosque view, but not in the area where you would likely sit). It was 'fine' - no big issues, but I just think there might be probably better options in the same price range.

The location is perfect! While we saw loads of tourist buses unload visitors at Blue Mosque or Aya Sophia, we used to walk 3 mins from our hotel to these locations. The trams are close by.

When I arrived in my room and went to the mini bar for some water. I found that the previous guests had opened and left the 2 bottles half empty. In any hotel, the mini bar should be re-stocked and changed immediately when the room is prepared for the next guest. The hallways seem to have a musty or mold smell to them despite this being a relatively new hotel. The conference rooms are located in the dark floors of -1. They have mold issues down there as one person who has a mold allergy had to be taken to hospital. The food in the restaurant is nothing near 5 star. The food is closer to 2 star. Even I could cook better than their main chef. The only thing that is 5 star in the restaurant are the prices. The staff in the restaurant are very nice.

The hotel is ultra swish and actually found the location to be about right. It will cost you 35 Euros from the airport, and will take approx 25 mins. (Cabbies are nutters) We stayed on the 13th floor and had a sea view which also looked over the pool. Room was beautiful and very spacious. All mod cons and everything you will need (No Iron) There is so much to do in the hotel like (Spa, Pool, Restaurant, Gym, Night Club on Saturday) We walked to the beach on the first day and did not realise how long the becahs was so settled in a nice spot which was busy but really nice. Food can be expensive but generally it is the drinks. Nice though. the one thing I would be wary of is the cost of drinks in the hotel A coke 5 Euros and vodka and Tonica 10 Euro's in the end I walked to the petrol station (1 minute walk) and bought water and cokes etc from there. Breakfast is 22 Euro's each. Very steap for what it is. More positives is the pool area. Lovely chilled pool enough beds as long as you get down about 9am and put your bag or one of their towels down. Food by the pool is lovely Service is lovely (always with a smile) Manged to get a check out at 2pm We went to two amazing restaurants: Ciutat Comtal (Rambla de Cantalunya 18) amazing tapas food. CDCL near the marina (prob the best restaurant I have ever been to) £50 per head roughly. (look on their website) I would also recommend the tour bus.

So I was really taken aback meeting this unfriendly lady in casa del'arte not!!! Although I told her the time of my arrival weeks before my arrival (by e-mail) she claimed not to have known about my arrival time (there is no reception in this accomodation). My knowledge of the Italian language (acquired at school, by traveling to Italy and through my friends who are native speakers) was sufficient to converse with the Roman people but one - with the lady in this accomodation it was neither possible to talk to neither in Italien, nor English or German. According to the hotel description the accomodation offers a luggage deposit for 2€ --> this information is not true! Instead the lady referred me in a quite unfriendly tone to the luggage deposit in stazione termini. Location: only a few steps from the metro and bus station; but the homeless people gather around the hotel all day drinking schnaps and at nights you have to reckon to get awakend by the bell (of course I didn't open the door, but I guess the homeless people tried to get into the warmth) Breakfast: a $@!#%, a croissant and coffee (thermos flask) served outside the room because the establishment has no breakfast room. coffee was sometimes ok, sometimes absolutely unenjoyable. once they seemed to have forgotten to do the washing up because the day after I could find remainings of the coffee in the cup. I could proceed my list with negative impressions but I guess this description gives you an expression what awaits you there. To sum up, I can say Rome is a beautiful city (December is perfect for sight-seeing!) with great sights and friendly people and I am sure to return there soon - but next time I definitly won't choose case del'arte!!!","ratings":{"Overall":1,"Service":1,"Value":1,"Rooms":2,"Location":3,"Cleanliness":1},"date":"2012-05-01 06:34:08 +0300","author":"Connie Quigley"},{"content":"The location is great. 20 minutes from Disney with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby.

We needed to take our dog with us on this last-minute business trip, so we picked the Red Roof Inn and booked on hotels.com since it was the same price as the other affordable hotel that isn't pet friendly. We arrived and checked-in with no issues. The late-night attendant was very friendly throughout our stay and always took the time to say hey when he saw us passing by. When we arrived to our 2nd floor room, I noticed it was humid, even though the A/C was turned all the way up. So, we requested a new room and was moved next door with no questions asked. The A/C worked fine in the new room, plus it had the added bonus of a fridge, which was very handy. There is construction going on across the street on the back side of the hotel, but it didn't really bother us. I did notice that the pool side was a bit noisier at night because of Hwy 192 traffic. The room layout was typical for a budget hotel, but was still clean, although a bit damp. But you're in Florida, so that's to be expected in a hotel with outside entry. We didn't request housekeeping every day, but when we needed to just change out towels, the housekeeping staff was very quick to bring us new towels. We had to extend our stay last minute by a few days, so we booked a new reservation on Hotels.com for a extra days and had no problems getting the staff to allow us to remain in the same room. We didn't make use of the shuttle to any of the parks since we drove, so we can't really give a review on that. The breakfast was typical 'continental' breakfast style - packaged pastries/muffins, cereal, juice, and milk. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would stay there again if we needed to stay in the Kissimmee area again. Definitely recommend if you have a pet you're bringing with you and want to find a budget hotel.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2013-02-02 18:42:12 +0300","author":"Kyler Howe"},{"content":"My family stayed here for our trip to the Disney and Universal parks.

As the quality of accomodation, some hotels were better and some of them worse than Red Roof Inn. But none of them had the greater staff than this hotel has... The rooms look very old but not the furnitures actually. The bed spreads and towels are worn out and may have big holes on them. The carpet was the worst to me because it felt so dusty even though they vacuumed regularly. In a hotel like this, the people make the difference. The first morning -after a very long flight- we were late for breakfast. The lady who is in charge didn't even mind bringing all the food and stuff back from the kitchen, just for us! And the continental breakfast was much better compared to ones I had before. It contained Bagels, Danish, bread, jelly, Peanut butter, cream cheese and butter. There was always good coffee available in the breakfast / reception area of the hotel. I enjoyed going there in the evenings to have coffee while watching the news on the big screen. We had to change our room to a deluxe and this was no problem either. As soon as a room became available, they gave us a deluxe room. I believe Raza is the guy behind the success of this hotel. He is a real problem solver. He does his best to make your stay a pleasent one... Also, the location of the hotel is good with restaurants and even Publix market all in walking distance. If you feel like having a really big breakfast or any other meal, just a few steps from the hotel is the Bob Evans where you can have some great food served by wonderful ladies there. The shuttle company Metro, which they have contract with, is not a very good one. We tried only once and took a cab the next days. Roundtrip to Magic Kingdom costs USD 40.00, from airport to hotel costs USD 45.00 As a result, when you pay less, you expect less, so this hotel is a friendly budget hotel with clean sheets, good breakfast and nice people. I may go back there again in the future and hope they change their carpets soon.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Value":4,"Rooms":4,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2015-06-11 02:41:34 +0300","author":"Rodrigo Abbott"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lon":-117.20831,"lat":32.87447},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1 858 453-0400","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":"$200-300","address":"4550 La Jolla Village Dr","description":"All-suites hotel."}

Probably a bit more than we should have done. There are actually many positives to this hotel - friendly and helpful staff and a passion for cleanliness. The carpets were being shampooed when we arrive and the smell of bleach was clear in bathrooms and restrooms. While this is clearly a hotel that is lacking investment, to the point of shabbiness, the local team obviously take pride in their work and want to do their best with what they have got. So we come to the negatives. Other reviewers have commented on the location - the Convention Center is a massive barrier to feeling part of Center City and the hotel is at the end of a long tunnel through the Center that does not always feel very safe. It is next to a homeless shelter, although this seems to be well run and we certainly did not experience any hassle from the neighbours at any time. The rooms are small but manageable for the odd night - I wouldn't stay here for any longer. The bedding and towels were clean but threadbare. The towels did not absorb any moisture and the bedding - well I have seen thicker fabric on showgirls in Las Vegas. The complimentary breakfast had reasonable coffee but is otherwise best passed over - Reading Market is less than five minutes walk and a much better option!

We stayed at the hotel the night of 16 January 2007. We paid about $96.00, including taxes, for the night. The Travelodge is located in a convenient location for visiting the city center and is in easy walking distance to the Convention Center, Chinatown, and historic attractions. Unfortunately, the location is also on a dark (at night) street in an unsafe looking area, where I would not have walked outside at night if I had not been accompanied by my son. There were many homeless people hanging out two doors down. The hotel has no parking on site, but recommends that you park in a 24 hour attended garage about a block down the street on the right just as you enter Chinatown. The garage is clearly labeled Travelodge Parking and the parking (at the time of writing) is $15.00 a day. The front desk clerk was extremely helpful and friendly. Unfortunately, we got a first floor room (#108), across from the check -in desk. I should have insisted on changing rooms right then, as I knew that a room next to the desk (and there are several of these) was going to be extremely noisy, and I was right. Not only was there noise off and on all night, at 3 am there was a great deal of commotion which resulted in the police being called, who ran around the hotel shouting for over 20 minutes (I never did find out what happened). They then spent several more minutes loudly gossiping with the front desk clerk until I called to complain about the noise and they left. Our room was TINY, the smallest I've ever stayed in, and that includes hotel rooms in New York City and Europe. There was just room for 2 double beds and there was no closet area. Instead, there was a coat rack which partially hung over one of the beds. The one window gave a view of the hall, so the curtains had to be kept shut all the time, unless you wanted everyone entering the hotel to look right into the room. It was rather like being in a tomb. On the plus side, the room was clean. Due to the very small rooms, noise level, and unsafe feeling location, I cannot recommend this hotel. I would especially caution single women travelers to stay clear, as it just didn't feel safe there.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":5,"Value":2,"Rooms":2,"Location":1,"Cleanliness":3,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2015-10-12 17:56:41 +0300","author":"Serena Ortiz"},{"content":"A great location adjacent to PA Convention Center makes this hotel a great value for the money.

As reported in earlier reviews, the suite layout is very similar to Embassy Suites... living area as one enters and the bedroom in the rear with the bathroom in the middle off a small hallway. The upholstery in the living room is very dated... dark and almost dingy looking. However, the beds were very comfortable with numerous feather pillows. Front desk staff is very friendly and greets all staff with warm chocolate chip cookies. However, the restaurant staff needs improvement. Although the free breakfast buffet is excellent, I was never acknowledged by wait staff to ask if I would like coffee... even though the restaurant was only about 1/4 occupied. In fact, the ONLY contact I had at the restaurant was with the hostess who seated me, who never smiled, I noted this on the comment sheet left on the table which also asked for a gratuity -- a pen was included making it easy for the customer to add a $ amount. I added both a comment and a small gratuity because the food was good although the friendliness was NOT. The decor of the public areas - lobby, restaurant, conference rooms are very attractive. On the 2nd Friday night we stayed, we were assigned to a 2nd floor suite in the back by the laundry and overlooking the large and very noisy AC/furnace and utility area. Our entry gate (#5) on the ground level had us walking by the multiple laundry carts which were left very messy and disorganized... a very poor introduction to the hotel guest area. Not only was there no view we could not have seen out because the outside windows were absolutely filthy! Again, the decor in this room was very dated, although the beds were quite comfortable. The AC in this room had some problems and the thermostat was flashing that the battery was low. I was finally able to get the temperature adjusted to a comfortable level. I called the front desk and requested a room change and was told there were no other rooms available... although the parking lot was practically empty at the time we checked in. My reservation request had been made approximately 1 month in advance and I had requested an upper level room (in fact, I have a standardized note on my hotel profile). We are Diamond level Hilton Honors members and are almost always assigned good accommodations. It is my understanding that room assignments are made either the day prior to the reservation or early in the AM of the reservation. If the individual making the room assignments had actually READ the reservation and assigned accordingly, perhaps our suite would have been better. The hair dryer did not work in the morning. However, when I called, a man from maintenance came immediately and got it operating correctly. (I thought housekeeping was supposed to ensure things in the room were operating correctly before they leave the room each day... at least this is what I learned when I took a hotel management courses). Another TA reviewer also noted that the ice and vending machines are on alternate floors. This is accurate, so that on floor #2 one has to go either up or down a level to obtain ice. The hotel has moved their Business Center to just outside the restaurant and bar area and now refer to it as an Internet cafe. There are 4 computer terminals that are easy to use with comfortable seating. Although the paper in the printer had run out, it was easy to locate more paper in the cabinet below and refill the paper tray. The bar tender seems to have the responsibility of checking in with guests using the terminal to see if any help is needed and he did come by to see if we needed assistance. The next time we are in the Phoenix area, we may try the Embassy Suites which is nearby... hopefully, the rooms will be more updated, room assignment requests will be honored and restaurant staff will be more friendly. By the way, the front desk has a preprinted handout that provides specific directions from the hotel to the rental car return at the airport. Be sure and pick this up as getting in and out of the airport from the rental car garages can be very complicated. Signage upon leaving the rental car garage is very poor and construction on the perimeters of the airport is very heavy.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":2,"Value":3,"Rooms":2,"Location":2,"Cleanliness":2},"date":"2014-03-29 23:50:26 +0300","author":"Bernhard Stroman"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-117.27373,"lat":32.84856},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1 858 454-0771","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":"$240-400","address":"1132 Prospect St","description":".

The suite is definately worth the price as the room is huge with a couch, several chairs, desk, bar area, etc. The bathroom was plenty big too. Everything was clean. If you reserve online, make sure you request a pool side view. The other side of the building is just parking lot, and not much to look at. The front desk person said they went through a major rennovation this year and are going to do the outside next year (2012). The staff were all very friendly. The breakfast in the morning was good. Nothing super fancy or crazy, but they had eggs, sausage, home fries, warm oatmeal, make your own waffles, etc. The pool area and jacuzzi were good. They even had towels out there. The airport shuttle was wonderful and very timely. Occassionally we could hear a plane way off in the distance, but overall it was very quiet. Not sure if we just didn't have anyone around us, but it was incredibly quiet. I am sure that someone who is extremely picky would find things wrong with this place. It is kind of set on a corner by a gas station right off the freeway. So, it's not in a 'fluffy' location, but it is nice, it's clean and we never once felt unsafe.

If you drink in the bars at the Biltmore, prepare to spend $12 - $15 / drink! They are amazing, but really? SO to grab a couple glasses of wine each night here really made more sense. The room we got was an ADA one (which I always seem to get). It was quite possibly the largest room (square foot size) i have ever been in. The walk-in closet could sleep 2 people alone! But they were missing a couple things: no floor length mirror anywhere; the bathroom light switch was outside the bathroom itself; very poor lighting in a large room.

The Ocotillo lounge with breakfast and all day coffee and tea service was a start attraction for our family:) We did not eat at the hotel's restaurants so can't review them. But all that we experienced was very nice. The one problem we had was that when we initially approached the hotel to book our reunion, we made clear to them that we have lots of kids - and they assured us they 'love families and kids'. But during our 3 day stay, we got the evil eye from other guests over our let's call it the kids' enthusiasm and inability to whisper 24/7.

We were very disappointed when we arrived because the oldest section of the hotel and restaurant were closed for renovation just two days earlier....They automatically upgraded our room and sent us chocolates (which were delicious) with a handwritten note. Telling the wonderful young woman who was our waitress at Frank and Albert's restaurant (forgot her name) about our disappointments, she introduced us to one of the waiters from Wrights, who introduced us to Jason, the Sous Chef who made us a special appetizer that we would have experienced if Wright's was open!

The \"kinks\" that I mention in my title have to do with some troublesome, minor details, but ones that the management might want to consider. I'd been advised by friends who had been there many times to ask for a room in one of the \"Cottages.\" Despite my having been assured that I was connected to the hotel desk when I called, the person I spoke with had no knowledge whatsoever of the cottages--and in fact, she thought I meant the Villas, which are very expensive and very different from cottages. When my husband and I arrived and made our way from the parking garage, we passed through--guess what?--many buildings labeled \"cottages.\" The front desk was puzzled by this gaffe, and we will try again the next time we visit. Although we had a lovely and large room in the Valley wing (and I agree with the person bemoaning the lack of in-room coffee), there is as of this writing no wireless at the hotel, a problem if you have a laptop such as a Macbook Air with no ethernet port. This was very surprising, and a clerk agreed: she said, \"This is 2011, right?\" When my husband turned on the water to take a shower (fortunately, he turned on the water from outside the tub), the entire shower head--one of those large \"rain\" shower head--flew off the connection and into the tub and then into the bathroom. Had he been in the shower at the time, well..... The staff members were eager to make things right when we brought things to their attention. (We hadn't mentioned the shower...) Our keys demagnetized four times--no exaggeration, despite our keeping them away from cell phones, coins, etc.--and when we went to the clerk yet again to have them fixed, the clerk said that such problems were not acceptable and, to our surprise, gave us a small but appreciated credit on our bill. SO...while there were glitches, we'd still go back. The staff members were eager to please, and the place is lovely.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2015-02-23 09:49:54 +0300","author":"Cassandra Bechtelar"},{"content":"wonderful place to relax, have stayed there several time, in cottages, or simple room by main pool. got this time a huge appartment with a terrace looking onto the golf course, amazing ! the hotel is like a village, you can walk around so many places and gardens !","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-01-27 05:02:43 +0300","author":"Modesta Wiegand"},{"content":"Day two of a four day stay.

Originally planned to stay at the Arizona Grand resort, which was much more affordable, but not nearly as luxurious. The Arizona Grand would have been great for a family on a budget, but the Biltmore was perfect for adults and business. Such a large resort, such beauty all around. So many pools! I imagine when it gets really hot, those pools get packed, but since there are several of them spread out amongst the resort, I imagine there's always room at one of them. Ate and Frank & Albert's several times. Great for breakfast - not bad for dinner, but not amazing. The staff was all great. We were placed in the main building on the 4th floor above the lobby. Couldn't imagine it gets any better. See my pic for the amazing view out of our window. The room was large and spacious, although I might have preferred wireless access over the one wired port in the room. Plenty of electrical outlets. Depending on what was going on, we could actually get a wireless signal from the lobby - but it wasn't always reliable. I found the Starbucks on the premises to be a little expensive ($5 for a croissant?!) but with Hilton Silver Honors, you get a free large coffee each day of your stay. I think I could have stayed there a week, and I imagine it only gets better when the weather really heats up. Self parking was the only minor hassle. It was a bit of a ways away, but still a pleasant walk. Not much around the resort itself. A shopping mall isn't too far away, but you'd need to drive anywhere.

My room was a cottage near the main lawn. It was a good size but the bathroom felt a little tatty and the shower was also a little worse for wear. Normally I would not care but the Biltmore is at the top-end of the market so everything should be spot on. The general hotel environment is lovely - especially the fire-pit area where you can chill with a nice glass of wine. The Biltmore gym has been re-kitted out since my last stay with an excellent variety of cardio kit.

Unfortunately, however, our recent stay there was terribly disappointing. Most all of the service was unfriendly, unhelpful and unresponsive. With the exception of a helpful bellman, one likable and funny waiter, a hair stylist, and few others, we were greeted with scowls, long waits (including for any phone inquiry), and frequent negligence. The incidents of poor service are too numerous to describe. Although our travel agent made certain that we requested an accessible room, we were put in a worn down room in the middle of the property inaccessible by car. We were taken in a golf cart past the laundry, tennis courts, far away from any services, and brought up the freight elevator since the bellman thought it would be faster than me trying to hobble down the long hallway. We were told that another closer room with a view would cost an extra $175 per night. It took a lengthy negotiation to land in a villa closer to the main building. The room was small with filthy, ripped up carpeting, a small, extremely old television and the worst hotel bed I have slept on in ages. The notice indicates that there is turn-down service, however, you will never need to call for it, since the maid staff turn down the bed in the morning. That's right, they never make the bed up completely. The poor service was more than frowning faces everywhere who acted like they were doing you a big favor to change a bill, or show you to a table. Never before have I been completely blown off by a concierge who I tipped 20$ to make a reservation for me at a local restaurant, and a hair appointment. That's right. I requested that he call and leave a message with the info at our room, but he did not. I left my glasses at the beauty salon, and the operator refused to put me through to the salon directly. I was transferred to security but there was no voice mail, back to the operator 3 times. I tried calling the spa, explaining that I was disabled and had to ask if someone could walk over to the salon to locate my glasses. The spa agent said she would, but she also never returned my call. There was an endless phone que for anything: room service, salon, housekeeping, security, spa. Terrible. The hostess in Frank's restaurant was beyond rude and unhelpful, though the food was fabulous. I will say that the food at the Biltmore was consistently superb: Frank and Al(?), the Wright room, the Cafe, room service. Do go to enjoy the grounds and the meals at the Arizona Biltmore.. Not one person inquired about our stay, and the rooms had no hotel survey about the staff, grounds or service, as most do. No wonder. It is clear that the management really does not care. Terrible, terrible attitude throughout the hotel. One other note about parking. Guests have two parking options: 1) valet parking in the main hotel for over $24.00 per day (excluding tips), or 2) self parking for $12.00 per day. Be advised that there are not enough self-parking places often, and you may have little choice but to pay the full valet parking fee when you return to your room on Saturday night and there is not a free spot anywhere.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":1,"Value":2,"Rooms":2,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":1,"Sleep Quality":1},"date":"2012-05-14 09:08:40 +0300","author":"Kallie Tillman"},{"content":"Traveling as a single lady it is nice to feel comfortable dining solo.

Booked standard double queen room and was upgraded to Ocatilla. Nice big room with big bathroom, pool view, so far we are impressed. Saturday afternoon pool was PACKED, but we were still able to find seats at the bar and lounges. No problem with towels. Bar menu was good, nice Greek salad, drinks were reasonably priced for a resort. Service at the bar was fine, a chef came out and did a salsa demonstration and gave samples to all who wanted. It was part of the Biltmore's 80th birthday celebration. So far so good..... right? .....not. Two teens we brought were VERY unimpressed witht he water slide and complained of bordom for the entire stay. The dive in movie that was promised and the kids were looking forward to didn't happen. As happy hour rolled around we went to use our key to get into the executive lounge (that is supposed to come with the Ocatilla upgrade) and lo and behold, it won't work. So I make a call to the front desk and was told since we recieved the room upgrade we were not entitled to the executive lounge too. BS! I went to the front desk and had a chat with the supervisor and was given new keys and access to the lounge. We had a glass or two of wine and a few snacks (all accurately described above) and headed back to the pool area for a light dinner. We didn't feel like getting gussied up for the fancy restaurant. Apparently we showed up about 20 minutes before closing time (8PM on a Saturday night!) and the waiter took 15 minutes in an almost empty place (only one other table occupied) to even come offer drinks. We ordered some chicken wings and salads and sandwiches which took another 25 minutes to arrive at our table. The wings were completely burnt to a crisp. My daughter and her boyfriend, both veteran fine dining establishment employees, were agast at both the quality of the food and the service. After a complaint to the server, the wings were taken off the bill, but too little too late. We were offered free dessert too but know better about ordering more food from a kitchen after complaining. You never know what you are going to get Forest. The resort is absolutely beautiful, the grounds, the views, the art and the history are impressive to us as 17 year Arizona residents. Don't waste your money staying or dining there. Maybe it was a skeleton summer crew in Phoenix and the service may be better there in the \"season\". I'll never go back. If you want to see the place and have a drink at Wrights bar, walk about the property for a few hours, you can get a feel for the place it used to be. Its nothing like that anymore.

I was disappointed. The hotel sells membership to the locals, so the main pool/spa becomes insanely crowded on the weekend. Because the pool was packed with people who weren't even staying at the hotel, I really resented the 28 dollar resort fee. The pool felt more like a public park than a resort. There were screaming kids everywhere, and their obese moms drinking pina coladas. It was Ohio in the desert. Just an awful scene. That said, the buildings are very pretty. Frank Lloyd Wright did not design it, but one of his students did, and it is a very pleasant imitation. As others have said here, it is getting a little worn. So, if you are looking for a family vacation, this might be a good hotel.

We happened to run into a Mr. Jeremy Beck, who was the director of the housekeeping crew and let him know how happy we were. Our dining experience in the Write restaurant was wonderful and fun. We got a kick out of the water/bread gentleman named Martin. He was charming and made us smile with his \"Good evening\" both nights we were there.

We ate pork chops and then the steak with mushrooms. Superb. I especially loved the tomato salad and my sweetheart loved the onion soup. I could go on and on. The bottom line is our stay at the Biltmore, in the Occotillo section of the hotel, was terrific.

The hotel seemed to be extremely understaffed as we noticed the same servers working full shifts at the pool and then also at the property's restaurants and lounges at night. Service was terribly slow at all of the restaurants, we waited more than 30 minutes for our waiter to bring us our check one night. On another occassion, our server brought us our drinks and when we gave her exact change (including tip), she exclaimed \"you guys are my favorite customers because now I don't have to come back and check on you.\" We sat outside at this lounge for 5 more hours that night and she never did come back and ask us if we wanted another drink.

I was expecting a beautiful, world class resort, but this was a shabby property that at one time may have been nice, but now is just worn out and tired. Everywhere I looked were signs of delayed maintenance. The overall look of the hotel is of an institutional compound with cement grey walls. There was nothing beautiful about it. The carpets were dirty, the landscaping in poor condition, the swimming pools were murky and cloudy, the pool side furniture faded, worn out, rusting. It was sad walking through the grounds and seeing areas where children are supposed to play ping pong, or on playgrounds, but there was overflowing garbage cans right there ruining any nice effect. At the spa, the showers had mildew growing in them, the towels were worn out and faded, and it had an overall cheap quality about it...not luxurious in the least. Parking is very poorly designed. There is only one self-parking lot at one end of the huge complex, and to get to my room I had to drag my luggage through back alley ways full of garbage and junk. The main restaurant is closed for renovations, so I ate at the casual cafe, where cocktails were $12. What a joke! All the food in this place is double or triple what it should be.

We opted for a change to the Paradise Wing overlooking the pool and they were able to accomodate. The \"pool exposure\" isn't entirely the greatest because we were a bit toward the rear. I am not a golfer so this resort did not have much appeal in that respect, but they do have a shuttle to the fashion mall. The assorted cafe's on the grounds are very overpriced as are the shops. In excess of $2.50 for a diet coke, not to mention mixed drink prices. Interestingly enough they had a nice lobby table set up with wine glasses, etc... appearred like an evening welcoming reception like they had at Sanctuary (in Arizona) but our hands were quickly slapped away as this was for \"wine dinner\" participants only. Very sad, then at least I might rope off the area or put out a sign! I think if you do a golf package you might be happier, again, I am not a golfer.

I had booked a room with a private bathroom the room with the shared bathroom was freezing and we had to wear our clothes to bed (first time I've ever worn a beanie to bed) and to go to the bathroom during the night my boyfriend said to wake him so I would not go alone. The next day we were moved to our \"booked\" room with a private bathroom. The Bathroom right off the bat was filthy, scum all around the shower and sink I had to stand on a plastic bag to shower as I did not have any thongs ($@!#% slops) with me as it was winter and snowing when we visited New York. The new room was also freezing and we had to stuff a towel around the air conditioner as we had cold air blowing in. The maid service that brought towels and changed the bed linen would come around and even though we requested privacy and told her we did not need new linen the maid would open the door whilst we were mid getting dressed! I felt unsafe staying at this hotel as the lock on the door was very flimsy, but because we had already paid to stay there my boyfriend talked me into staying and he slept on the side closest to the door. Not to mention the elevator was ancient. I would never stay here again the price for this place is ridiculous for what you get.

I requested a refrigerator 2 months prior to our arrival. I called to confirm the request and was assured it would be in the room upon our arrival. After our 10 hour flight no fridge. We were told they were all sold out and that we may not get one. After about 2 hours, we did get one. We kept getting calls about having no water for 2-3 hours each day for the majority of our stay. One night a pipe broke and water was shut off. We could not shower nor flush the toilet. Then when water was restored for the rest of the hotel our room was not turned back on and we were til midnight before we got water restored. This again was after repeated calling. They did give us a free breakfast the next morning for our trouble however, we really rather of had a shower that night. Then one day we got back after being out all day and our room was not cleaned. I had to call and the maid came and did clean our room. It was not vacuumed the whole stay and the tub was not very clean. The pillows were not comfortable at all and the bed was just okay. BEWARE OF THE INDOOR POOL DECK it is slippery. Oh and bring towels because they sometimes run out and you might be left dripping wet without anyway to get dried off. We were charged for parking when we didn't even have a car the whole time we were there. It was resolved but it should have never been added. People working there are not very friendly nor do they act as thought they are happy to accommodate your needs. We will not stay again.

The Harvest Inn provided very pleasant accommodations. The hotel's scenery is wonderful--it backs onto a vineyard of cabernet and merlot grapes--and the rooms are spacious, if simply furnished (we stayed in the \"Rose\" section of the hotel). Check in: the reception area is in the main building, which formerly was used as a winemaker's club, apparently. Lots of carved wood, bricks, and \"lodge-y\" ambiance. It was decorated very nicely for the holidays. We encountered a problem at check-in (we were given keys to two king rooms, and had to return to get another room for the double queens), which the hotel remedied quickly if a little grumpily. There's no one to help bring your bags to your room, so be prepared to shlep bags from your car to the room. Rooms: the rooms are really spacious and offer a mini-fridge and some complimentary beverages. The decor feels a little dated, and the plumbing fixtures in both of our rooms were a little \"off\" (you had to turn the shower knobs several times to get the water going). For me, the worst part was the beds--they felt really old, with tired springs that were truly uncomfortable. Amenities: Though there are 2 pools on the property, the one closer to our room was out of service. The other, working pool has a hot tub and a nice view of vineyards and redwood trees. The breakfast buffet was basic but very convenient. Overall a very nice stay but somehow we felt that the Harvest Inn fell a little bit short in terms of service and quality of room for the price we paid.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":3,"Value":2,"Rooms":4,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":3},"date":"2013-10-07 19:08:43 +0300","author":"Elise Kertzmann"},{"content":"We stayed two nights at the Harvest Inn for a birthday occasion for my brother, who went upscale elsewhere (his birthday splurge!).

The location in St. Helena is very convenient to the charming town and local wineries. The room we had was a deluxe king, with fireplace (it was in the 90's outside, so we didn't use it). The room was large, clean, although darkish. The bed was very comforting. The fridge had complimentary water and cola. The bathroom was spacious with tub/shower and two sinks, which we consider a plus. The closet was roomy and detached from the sleeping area. There was a large tv with dvd player. Breakfast was included and plentiful -- quiche, hot sausages, fruit, cereal, excellent baked goods, yogurts, juices. My daughter enjoyed her upstairs room, with a deck. There were two pools and jacuzzies on the property. There are spa/massage services available. The grounds are beautiful -- redwood trees, large lawns and roses, adjacent to a vineyard. A wedding was going on Saturday. Call the hotel directly for the best room rates. There are some great restaurants in St. Helena: Greystone on the high end; Cook and Cindy's Backstreet Kitchen were excellent in the moderate range.

I am a diamond hilton honors member and when I checked in the front desk told me if I could wait 1 hour then she would put me in a nicer, bigger room. We agreed because we thought we would get a bite to eat then come back. The room wasn't ready in an hour. Nor was it on the right side of the hotel as told. I opened the door and it was like being on the shoulder of the freeway. You coud really hear the traffic. I went back down to complain and it was a new person behind the desk who put me in the room that I refused an hour and a half ago. My profile states that I do not want a room near the elevator. It was the first room from the elevator and Mark Rincon from the front desk said that was the only room available. They were sold out and the original room that I was supposed to get was already given to someone else. He comped us breakfast that next morning. I don't normally do the breakfasts for two reasons: they aren't healthy or good. I have on my profile that I want the reward points. So since that was given to us, we went upstairs to the breakfast on the executive floor just for some decaf and bananas for the road. There were eggs but that was it. The fruit platter was empty. There was a bagel on a platter and there was no decaf. When you pumped the coffee container grounds spit out at you. I took my cup downstairs when I checked out and was told someone would bring us two cups of decaf from the gift shop. Well after waiting my husband went to the gift shop and the woman behind the counter told him he could pump his two complimentary cups. What a waste of time both days. I didn't sleep well from the people getting off the elevator and going down the hallway talking. I made a complaint and got a really unsincere apology from Mark. I highly recommend the HIlton Gaslamp for your stay in San Diego. I tried this hotel because that one was sold out and it was a huge mistake.

What impressed me most about this hotel was the service. From check-in all the way through checkout I found everyone in the hotel to be very friendly and accommodating. The most surprising thing was the hotel's response when I asked for a late checkout time the day of my departure.

TRANSPORTATION The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle from the airport to the hotel. I was told to call the front desk upon arrival to the airport since it takes about 15-30 minutes for the shuttle to arrive. Since the hotel was sold out (due to the conference) the shuttle was very slow. I ended up waiting for an hour for the shuttle. There were others who were waiting but were given a voucher to be used on a taxi to get to the hotel. The trolley stop is about half a block across the street from the hotel. We went to the Gaslamp district (a must see in the evening! Most stores are open til 8pm) for dinner. We had to transfer twice and thankfully had other tourists with us who knew how to get there....otherwise, it might save you the hassle of transfers by taking a taxi. Roundtrip trolley ride cost us each $5. The trolleys only run every half hour in the evenings, so it ended up taking us about 1.5 hours to get back to the hotel (which should normally take about 30 minutes!) Looking back at it, if we had more than 2 people, taking a taxi might've been more time/cost effective. CHECK IN Check in was easy and went smoothly. You get a warm chocolate chip cookie (that was DELICIOUS!!) at the front desk. (you can get them anytime and as many as you'd like). I was staying with a roommate who had put both of our names on the room so that I could check in without her being there. Someone else was checking in the same time I was and didn't do this...she had to contact the roommate and it took her a while to get a hold of her. So be sure to have all names on the room if you're checking in separately. AMMENITIES The gym was recently remodeled and VERY NICE! The equipment was very high quality (precor) and each of the eliptical machines, stationary bicycles and treadmills had their own individual tvs. There's also a large flat screen tv. There's exercise balls, stretchy cords, medicine balls and lots of free weights as well as a weight machine. There's benches and a crunch helper machine. This was the best-stocked gym that I've ever seen in a hotel. The pool and hot tub looked nice although I didn't go in. There's 2 outdoor fire pits that are lit in the evenings. These were nice to sit by (nice furniture too) as the evenings are pretty balmy. Our conference used the large ballroom and most of the individual rooms. The large ballroom was beautiful and very bright. The individual rooms were a little small for some of the workshops and slightly claustraphobic-feeling as there's not windows. The hotel itself was very nice and clean. Service was pretty helpful and friendly overall. FOOD There's a bar and lounge area. My roommate ate their pizza at the bar and she said it was about $9 for a personal vegetarian pizza that tasted pretty fresh. There's also a restaurant-- it looked like they have an omelet bar on weekends. We didn't eat here since we had conference food. The conference food was okay.....nothing to write home about. But I did notice staff replenishing food very quickly. Service was very good and attentive. The hotel is very conveniently located near several restaurants within walking distance. If you walk up the stairs in the lobby, you'll find a little strip mall-like series of shops. There's an educators store, a sports bar, applebees (i think), barne's and noble and some other stores. There's also a movie theater. There's a small cafe that's open for breakfast and lunch. Metrazzano cafe? They have good wraps and sandwiches and some interesting iced teas.

It's got the most amazing view of any of the hotels I've seen in Southern California, and a great helpful staff. The outside patio is a little beat up, but they make do with nice tables and chairs to enjoy the view.

Gardens are lovely. Pool is small. Rooms are redone aged motel. Beds are good quality. Culture of the staff is that it is incumbent upon the customer to tell them what they need when there is a problem and not incumbent upon the staff to initiate or be energetic/enthusiastic about solving the problems. And the problems I experienced were EGREGIOUS: the floors were dirty, found a long black hair on my pillow, the showerheads were not adjustable and spewed strong water horizontally across the shower, three piles of dog poop on the lawn outside our room went unpicked up for a day, the closet smelled moldy (the only place to hang the designer dress I'd bought for the wedding I was to attend!), the pricey ocean-\"view\" room did face the ocean but could not be seen from inside due to the small high windows AND the stairway that was adjacent to the windows (everyone upstairs walked up and down these stairs looking directly into my room!), and FINALLY THE WORST: when donning the bathrobe in the morning to head to the pool, I found an unwashed pack of used matches in the pocket: THE BATHROBE HAD BEEN WORN BEFORE AND NOT WASHED FOR MY STAY!!!! ICK. The staff responded to this extremely casually, did wash the robe and return it to my room, but NEVER offered to compensate me in any way. When talking with the manager the following Tuesday (first chance to catch him and I had to initiate the call even after an email to him delineating the problems!), he also was extremely casual, never offered to comp a night or offer me a free future night (traditional hotelier solutions), but went on at length about how he agreed with the items that were problems and how he'd fixed them or would fix them. NEVER ONE WORD about me the customer, about fixing my negative experience with him. When I finally said something about how cavalier they are and that any other hotel would offer me a comped night, he became extremely passive-aggressive and said that had I asked him for this at the outset, he would have comped me a night, in fact he would have comped me the whole weekend AND given me a future stay for free; but now that I was a bad customer (what?! I listened to him drag on for 20 minutes about his hotel!), he would not do a thing for me and in fact advised me that I was banned from his hotel. ROTLFMAO. Like I would EVER return! I then advised him that this was the problem with the staff culture at the hotel: they think it's incumbent upon the customer to pay them AND to advise them how to perform. I advised him that in the hotel industry it is, in fact, incumbent upon the hotelier to serve the customer who is paying them. So if you stay here be sure to 1. bring up every problem you have immediately with the staff when you discover it and have them fix it asap and maybe comp you a night if you have the seriously disgusting problems I had and 2. be sure to never indict the staff for their laissez faire attitude and responses or you'll get blamed for being an inadequate customer.","ratings":{"Overall":1,"Service":1,"Value":1,"Rooms":1,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":1,"Sleep Quality":1},"date":"2014-12-29 06:46:28 +0300","author":"Jaycee Lockman"},{"content":"great service, beautiful views and amazing rooms. the people that work there are super friendly and next time i go back to san diego i will definitely stay there again.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-05-27 14:17:27 +0300","author":"Mr. Harley Oberbrunner"},{"content":"My boyfriend and I drove from LA to San Diego and decided to stay one night at Sunset Cliffs to experience the more beachy side of San Diego before staying in the city for the new year.

(Do get a transit pass, by the way--at $5.00 a ride the cable car fares really add up fast). The hotel is old but perfectly maintained, and has all the charm and character you could hope for. Our room, a corner on the 11th floor, was outfitted with all the luxuries you would expect, and more (like an umbrella, clever two-way shades in the bathroom so you could see out but no one could see in, and the newpaper (NY Times, no less) delivered in a cloth bag on your doorknob.)

This was my second visit to the Mark Hopkins. I stayed here last year with my partner and never imagined I would experience the same problems all over again!Last year I booked directly with Intercontinental and was assigned a substandard room when I clearly booked and paid a lot of money for a high level room with a Financial District view. After much huffing  puffing on my part I was eventually assigned the room that I had paid for. I had hoped this was an oversight last year, but I was annoyed to return a year later to encounter the same experience leads me to believe this hotel has some staff in needs of some serious training issues in guest relations and hotel hospitality!As I was arriving late (11pm), I had emailed the hotel directly 2 weeks in advance to confirm my reservation and to ensure that the hotel knew I would be arriving late. My email was answered by Guest Relations and I was welcomed back to the hotel as a returning client. On arrival, check-in was less than welcoming and I was not welcomed as a Platinum level Priority Club account holder. I was also, rather rudely, informed that the hotel was full 鈥?why should this concern me? Despite requesting a high floor and having booked and paid for a superior room via Venere.com at $350 a night without tax, I was allocated a room on the 4th floor facing the street. This was not the best start to a holiday after a 20 hour journey. The 5th floor room also had dirty towels lying on the bed. I returned to reception to complain and was told that I would need to speak to a manager. I questioned whether the room allocated was indeed a superior room which was confirmed as such although having stayed in the hotel before I find that hard to believe. I commented on the dirty towels on the bed and stated that the room was unacceptable and did not match my booking. The only response from the on duty manager was a smirk and an 鈥淥ops鈥?in regard to the dirty towels. He also told me that the hotel was full. Was this supposed to excuse the fact that I was allocated a room that was unsatisfactory? I never received any apology. Eventually I was allocated a smoking room on the 9th floor 鈥?my booking and my Priority Club profile clearly states a non-smoking preference. Reluctantly, I accepted this for one night as I was very tired from travelling and it was now almost midnight local time. On the second night I was moved to a non-smoking room on the 11th floor with the proper view, at my request. Overall, I was very disappointed with the service that I received at the hotel and was given the general feeling that the staff were doing me a favour by accommodating me for something that I had already paid for! My subsequent stay at the new Intercontinental San Francisco was a completely different, and better, experience and I will never again return to stay at the Mark Hopkins.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":2,"Value":2,"Rooms":2,"Location":2,"Cleanliness":3,"Business service":-1,"Check in / front desk":1},"date":"2015-06-23 13:21:58 +0300","author":"Ward Zemlak"},{"content":"5 Star service without the Attitude!~ We are a family of 5 with 3 small children, usually 5 star hotels or small boutique hotel dont always let us feel welcome......We booked this hotel after I saw it on travel channel, the room is good size , clean, bed is comfy, but since the hotel is older , I think the AC just blew on one side of the room, We love the size of our bathroom, but they can improved of the toiletries.

They're even better at the Top of the Mark bar, though we didn't go there. We might have gone, but the champagne brunch was $59--that's right five nine--dollars per person. That price reflects an unseemly emphasis on cash extraction at the Mark Hopkins--$60 to use the club room, $51 to park (not that you need a car there--we didn't have one). Unlike many historic hotels, there's almost no free public space. They even have set out bottles of water in our room, marked $5.95, pretty tacky for a hotel where a cheap room costs over $200. It all leaves a bad taste and detracts from the experience. Our room was pleasant enough (though nether historic nor artistically designed, though there were some nice photos on the wall), with a great view out to the Golden Gate Bridge. Most central San Francisco locations have another building adjacent, but the Mark Hopkins doesn't, maximizing the view.The king bed was big and acceptably firm, darkness (and lighting) was adequate. W eclearly heard the cable car outside 15 floors below, but it wasn't too bothersome. The bathroom was modest size but well-equipped, though the tub didn't look too great for taking a bath.Somebody raised an issue about the hotel's having only 3 elevators and causing waits, but that wasn't a problem for us. The location is good for getting to North Beach, Chinatown, Russian Hill restaurants, and Union Square. Many of these locations are only a few blocks away, but people should be aware that they're down steep hills from the hotel.

We are Platinum Priority members and I don't know if that made a difference, but our check in was very smooth. The room wasn't quite ready yet (we got there at 10:00 a.m.) but the front desk put a rush on getting it ready and we went down to Fisherman's Warf for a quick bite to eat. When we got back, everything was ready. We stayed on the 12th floor in a corner room with a specacular view of both the city and the bay. We did have one snafu in the the tub/shower knob came off with the water running full tilt. We called down and reported a plumbing emergency and within moments a technician was there and fixed the problem. He was very professional and polite. If you can swing it, I highly recommend joining Club Intercontinental. They put out quite a spread and Ulysses was a fabulous concierge. Ask him about the French restaurant he recommends. For $60 per room per day, I feel you definitely get your money's worth in food and beverages alone, to say nothing of the internet access, books, games, service, etc. Top of the Mark was a bit of a disappointment in that the city was completely fogged in the night we were there, so no view. Very high prices but the drinks were good. Bar tenders could be a bit more outgoing and friendly (we sat at the bar). We did have a great experience with the hotel staff - definitely did not see the rude behavior mentioned by others. To a person everyone was very attentive, polite, and professional (again, especially Ulysses at Club Intercontinental). Even the bartenders at the ToM were polite, just not overly friendly or enthusiastic. If you are in San Francisco on a weekend, absolutely try to find time to check out the Farmer's Market at the Ferry Building/Terminal. It's amazing! I wish to goodness we had something like that in Tampa!","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":3,"Rooms":4,"Location":-1,"Cleanliness":4,"Business service":-1,"Check in / front desk":-1},"date":"2014-12-28 00:04:50 +0300","author":"Melany Hoeger"},{"content":"Very expensive for what you get Stayed there as a treat hoping for wonderful service and to be pampered.Got average service in an average room for A LOT of money.Have to admit that the bathroom was just absolutely fabulous but really, how much of your time is spent in there????","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":2,"Value":1,"Rooms":1,"Location":-1,"Cleanliness":4,"Business service":-1,"Check in / front desk":-1},"date":"2014-02-23 03:47:20 +0300","author":"Krystal Yost"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lon":-122.4287,"lat":37.7625},"free_breakfast":true,"email":"info@parkerguesthouse.com","phone":"+1 415 621-3222","vacancy":false,"free_parking":true,"price":"$139–$249","address":"520 Church St","description":"A gay owned and operated hotel in a very pretty old building."}

If you have a car and will require parking, book the San Francisco Package (available Mon 28 June 2004-Friday 31 December 2004). I made my reservation on Intercontinental's website and received a rate of $209. plus room tax: $26.46, for a total of $235.46 for Friday, August 27th, 2004. The S.F. package includes a full American breakfast at The Top of the Mark ($57), overnight parking ($50), two complimentary cable car passes per day ($18), and late check out (2pm). I stayed in room 520, had a king bed with a beautiful city view, highlighted with a fountain and cathedral. The bathroom is very tiny, but is lavishly done in marble, chrome hardware, and not enough towels. After requesting additional towels, which were immediately delivered, the room had everything I could hope for. The breakfast is excellent and the view is breathtaking. I heard the Tongo which is across the street at the Fairmont is a must for a cocktail, unfortunately did not have the time to check it out. If you are shopping, Macy's offers a 12% discount card, just show your hotel key at gift wrap. The discount card is good for one day. San Francisco is a great week-end destination with lots of romance and adventure; but all those memories are superior when you stay at the right place.

The service here was top notch from beginning to end and we felt pampered and luxurious. From what I can tell by reading previous reviews it must be that some of the rooms have not been renovated yet. Perhaps when booking you have to be very careful to ask for a renovated one. If enough people do that will it put pressure on mgmt to cough up the $$ to finally renovate all of them? I feel badly for the people who got bad rooms when they were expecting luxury. I also feel a bit badly that the Huntington is being labeled a ripoff and horrid when our experience was the polar opposite of that. Anyway...Our room was on the 11th floor, had a huge flat screen TV on the wall, brand new carpet, bath fixtures, beautiful mirrors everywhere. It was a nice large room (although it was the cheapest available) and there was enough room for a conversation area which were two comfy overstuffed chairs and table. I sat in one of the chairs a long time and watched the fog roll in over the city. The view was excellent, over the city and toward Twin Peaks.You will really be missing out if you stay here and do not book a treatment in the spa. We had massages and pedicures. The sun deck overlooking the city, the infinity pool, the jacuzzi- all great. Again the service was great and they anticipated our needs from the beginning. I will definitely stay here again.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Business service":-1,"Check in / front desk":4},"date":"2013-11-13 15:46:38 +0300","author":"Ms. Etha Graham"},{"content":"great location and good service After a bad night at the Laurel Inn we decided to check in to a large hotel.

We paid the extra $6 a day for valet parking since the parking was already some of the cheapest in town. We went up the elevator to the 14th floor (I had requested a high room at the back as I am very sensitive to noise). We went into the room and was amazed to find that this was a suite! Bedroom, Living Room, and two FULL bathrooms!! The room was immaculately clean and tastefully decorated. The bathrooms had shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and rubber duckies!! The bed was comfortable, there was a small walk in closet, there were extra pillows and blankets in the closet. Small refrigerator, coffee maker in a little kitchen area. Desk in the living room. And a chair and table in the bedroom. Lots of drawers for putting stuff away. And a TV in each room. This meant my husband could watch TV in the living room whilst I read in the bedroom. And the location was right across the street from the St Francis and Sax Fifth. There was a Starbucks at the corner so we could grab breakfast. Union Square at the corner. Cable car runs right out front! I could still hear the cable cars but not very much. Earplugs were able to bring complete silence.

I was just as happy with my time here on this trip as I was before. Since this was a longer stay, I had a chance to take advantage of the hotel bar and restaurant. I had breakfast at Luque's twice and the service was prompt and the prices reasonable. It's nice to not have to look for a place to eat before heading out for the day. It's also nice to be able to hit Happy Hour at your own hotel before heading to a show. While it's not a large hotel, it gives you more of that feeling of going back to your own apartment at the end of the day than that sterile feeling you sometimes get from a larger property. It's not unusual for me to get tired of a hotel after a few days, but that did not happen at the Chancellor. It's in a perfect location when you are using public transportation to get around. Same as last time, all the employees I came in contact with were friendly and helpful. I asked for a refrigerator this time and it was very handy to have. It was brought up to the room as soon as I checked in and I didn't have to wait around. Everything in the room worked and my room location on the side of the building was very quiet. The bed was comfortable and I had no problem falling right to sleep.

We opened the windows, obviously it was fairly noisy being right in the city centre but it didn't keep us awake. Breakfast at the restaurant downstairs was very good. Although the staff didn't volunteer any information when we approached them subsequently they were helpful. The location is great - short walk to China Town and North Beach, right on Union Square with a tram stopping outside so you can get around everywhere really easily. You can buy a MUNI transport pass in the reception - its good value and the staff at the kiosk were brilliant.

Two nights later, I moved to a room at the back of the hotel on the 12th floor, where it was a lot quieter than on the 5th floor. Kudos to the front desk staff who not only arranged for me a room on a higher floor but also had my luggage moved while I was out attending a conference that day. Although the room was a little small, I found it was cozy and clean. The bed was large and comfortable and I slept well. There was no air-conditioning in the room and no need for it since it was cool enough when the windows were opened. Complimentary wireless internet worked without any problems.

Although, I did not hear noise from the neighboring rooms, the noise from outside the hotel was unbelievable. I checked the windows twice to make sure they were closed. It sounded like the street was running right through the room. The windows are not double paned and they are useless in blocking out noise. I felt like I should tip the street musicians on Union Square since it sounded like they were playing in my room. Powell Street is very busy and the noise did not diminish all night. There is no air conditioning and the evening was quite warm. I thought I would be saved by the ceiling fan. In theory, this would provide some cooling air and some white noise. However the fan was so poorly mounted to the ceiling, that even at the lowest speed it shook so badly I was certain it would fall out at any moment. Further it had a noisy and irregular rattle that added to the general cacophony. I would suggest that future guests insist on a room away from the street and check out the ceiling fan before settling in. Other than the noise, which as you can gather, was a big problem, I liked other aspects of the hotel. The location is good, and the price, considering the cost of other comparable hotels was quite reasonable. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful.

The Chancellor Hotel is located conveniently in midst of Union Square with easy access to shopping, dining and transportation.

The staff was always friendly and extraordinarily helpful (particularly the bellman!), and yes the cookies were in the lobby and they were warm. No, there is no air conditioning, but a nice ceiling fan made up for that along with windows that open wide to the street below, plus August is usually cool with foggy days and evening. While I enjoyed the sounds of the city late into the evening, my husband was frustrated with the noise and had trouble sleeping. I've read that a request for a high floor on the back of the hotel may eliminate this problem. The room was appealing with a comfortable bed, and the candy dish made the kids smile. The hotel is lined with old fashioned fire escapes and I was heard to quickly proclaim \"NO!\" as my 12 year old daughter asked \"Is that our balcony and can I go out there??\" Luques was marginal... pricey for Dennys-like fare, I would not return.

We had a sitting room, 2 full bathrooms, 2 TVs (not that we used them!), fridge and coffee making facilities, a pillow menu, and an awesome fire escape that we could sit out on in the evenings and just listen to the music drifting up from union square, admiring the views. We were given a free bottle of champagne and a picture frame as a special honeymoon present, which was a lovely touch. All staff we met were extremely friendly and helpful (special mention to Matt - you were great, always anticipating needs and so helpful - thanks :) But really, everyone was great. We had breakfast a few times in the dining room, and enjoyed that each time, and also enjoyed the bar for a drink before heading out each evening. The location is perfect, right on union square, right beside a cable car stop, and just down the street from a major transport hub, with MUNI bus, BAST and street cars very plentiful. All in all, this part of our honeymoon was our favorite, due to the fact that SF is such an amazing city, but especially because of how great the Chancellor is.

They helped us make a good choice and they called and made us a dinner reservation. My luggage didn't make our connecting flight, but when we returned to the hotel that evening, my suitcase had been delivered and hotel staff put it in our room -- it was waiting for me there instead of downstairs at the front desk. Front desk was professional, helpful and competent. Soda, water and snacks were available for a reasonable price, and there were ice machines on every floor. The hotel feels classy and refined, with lots of brass and glass. Classic and tastefully understated decor. I rearranged the chairs in the room to give us a little more space -- but everyone says the rooms in SF are always tiny. Our room was small but not tiny. The bed was very comfortable. I didn't realize that they didn't have king beds, but the queen room we had (for a very reasonable price) was more than adequate. Great mattress and pillows. We didn't feel cramped. We are average sized people. If you are larger, you could request room with two twin beds and possibly put them together for a king? The bathroom was small, but very nice, and had a HUGE tub (no jets). They provided bath salts and I took advantage of a nice hot bath after we returned from walking all over SF for most of the day. No A/C, but we didn't need it. You can request a high or low floor, and you can request a \"quiet\" room. We were on the 10th floor on the back. It was perfect. We had a great view and no noise from the busy street on the front. This hotel is on the cable car line which runs up and down Powell Street. Very convenient. Just walk outside and there is a cable car stop -- you're on your way. The breakfast offered in this hotel was outstanding. Lots of great choices. I had New Orleans Eggs Benedict -- fantastic and fresh! Good coffee and service. Affordable and reasonable. Next door to Sears Inn, which has great swedish pancakes. Easy to get a cab to and from this hotel -- cabbies knew where our hotel was just by providing the name. I can't think of anything negative about this hotel.

We were on a road trip down to LA via the big sur and needed a good start in San Francisco to set us on our way. Booked with trailfinders and were very pleased with the hotel choice. Good service all round, checking in was a breeze , lovely room with a view of Union square , comfortable bed , small yet adequate bathroom. Shower was powerful and considering that it was very warm during our stay the lack of air con was not a problem as the fan above the bed was nice and cooling. Loved the free tea and cookies in reception. Didnt have breakfast in the hotel as sears is next door and heard that they cooked a lovely pancake sandwich so ate there every morning and i wasnt disappointed.

Everything about this hotel was perfect for a typical San Fran boutique hotel. The ONLY issue you may have is the very, very small rooms. Maybe 12 X12 with a bathroom that you must enter in the direction you wish to face because turning around might be ifffy......BUT none if this posed a problem for my daughter and I. Rooms very cozy and nicely decorated. Comfy beds. Staff very, very pleasant. We were out and about most of the day so room size didn't bother us. I felt the regular prize ($200 per night) was steep for such a small room but watch for deals on Expedia, we got for $125 and my sister leaves next week and got it for $99. San Fran is amazing...just go with the location (there are areas like the Tenderloin that you definately DO NOT want to be in).

I had stayed there three years ago and had a superb experience. My second stay was just as exceptional. This little gem of a hotel runs like a well-oiled machine. Every staff person we encountered was lovely, efficient, friendly and well-mannered. We stayed in Room 1203. I had asked for a high floor room facing Union Square which was acommodated. After the first night, I mentioned to Rory at the front desk that the bed was not quite as comfortable as I had remembered it being during my previous stay (in a different room). We returned to the hotel late that afternoon to find that a foam topper of some sort had been placed on the mattress. Problem solved! The valet parking was easy and convenient and well worth the cost. $29 I believe. Allow 30 mins. for your car to be brought around. Well worth the value and convenience, since SF is a terrible parking city. The cleanliness of the room was exceptional each day. I can't say enough about this. The linens and douvet are very nice and the pillows are extremely comfortable. I cannot say enough about what an outstanding hotel the Chancellor is. As evidence of this, check out the piece in today's (9/9/10) NYT, the Chancellor and Wes Tyler, the GM are featured, in a piece about bed bugs.

Flying in from London Heathrow we arrived at San Francisco on the Monday afternoon of Labor Day right at the start of September. The weather was lovely and the road from the airport was very quiet, the cabbie said itâ€™s not normally like this! Our first destination was three nights at the Chancellor Hotel, Powell Street, Union Square. Wow! What a lovely hotel in such a fantastic location, just a very short walk to the main Union Square and right on one of the cable car lines. Being from England I donâ€™t fully understand the concept of â€˜blocksâ€™ we donâ€™t use that term, but perhaps half a block to the square? Whatever itâ€™s very close. The people on reception are very helpful and friendly and on our check out day they advised us on the best option for collecting our hire car. The office was only on Oâ€™Farrell but they got us a cab there because of our luggage. Ok our two rooms didnâ€™t have a coffee maker but we always bring our travel kettle and tea bags, so we purchased some milk from a store just a few yards away. And there were flasks of complimentary coffee available on the ground floor near the bar area, with cookies and popcorn also. We had breakfast in Luques on two mornings and loved it there, and the other morning we ate pancakes in Sears which is right next door...delicious! The first evening we didnâ€™t really eat much as it was around 3-4 am in the morning on our UK time, so we felt a bit spaced out. The next night we had takeout pizza and the last night we ate at the Cheesecake factory on top of Macyâ€™s. This had great views over Union Square. All in all we loved this hotel and loved SF, what a fantastic place! On Thursday morning we picked up our hire car, got upgraded to a seven seater Chevy Uplander and started our journey to Yosemite View Lodge.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2014-04-16 05:34:36 +0300","author":"Kali Deckow"},{"content":"We stayed for 4 nights in June 2010. They have no a/c, which is standard in this part of the country, so you sleep with the windows open. It was perfectly comfortable (we didn't see the FIRST insect, it was cool and breezy)...but it was noisy, because we had a room fronting Powell Street, directly off of Union Square. If you stay here, and you certainly should, just ask for a room on the back side of the building, away from the street. Aside from that, our only complaint was the size of the rooms - since its just two of us, and didn't spend a lot of time in the room, it was just fine. The bathrooms are VERY small though - the kind where you almost have to stand in the shower to shut the door, because the toilet is in the way. Again - just fine for us. And we're average sized people. But they're definitely smaller than average (its a historic property). Room was terribly comfortable though - and their pillow menu was really cool. We sampled two, and I may even buy myself a buckwheat pillow now. I slept like a baby. Very comfortable bed as well (including the standard pillows). They had lovely relaxing bath salts along with the standard shampoos, etc. SPECIAL TOUCHES: The front desk staff routinely gave us easy bus directions and great maps to help us out. We also arrived on our anniversary, and the hotel left a bottle of sparkling wine (Napa) and some truffles in our room. The cable cars stop DIRECTLY in front of the hotel, and the F-Tram line is a few blocks down the street. We used the city bus system mostly, and several lines stop within a block or two. Its location on Union Square makes it an easy crossroads for transportation and shopping is great. Several restaurants in the area as well. We didn't eat the hotel restaurant though, so can't include that in the review. Hint - there's a Borders a few doors down, and they have hot breakfast sandwiches and lovely pastries with their Seattle's Best coffee, for much less money than the local restaurants. In sum - ask for a room away from the street (and a high floor perhaps), and if you don't mind a smaller room, this makes a GREAT home base for exploring San Francisco. We would definitely go back.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":3,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2013-01-17 16:11:24 +0300","author":"Ebba Kunde"},{"content":"My stay at The Chancellor was outstanding!

They have new LCD TVs, but only 20 channels (HBO). Free wi-fi was adequate for web browsing, but don't expect to stream video. Location couldn't have been better. You're right in the heart of Union Square. You can walk out the front door and get on a cable car that takes you to Fisherman's Wharf. There's a major transportation hub about 4 blocks south of the hotel that can get you on a train to SF Giants, Oakland Athletics, Airport, and Stanford University (1 transfer). Definitely no need for a vehicle. You also have the option to travel one block to a pretty nice gym (complimentary).

It's more or less directly opposite Union Square and one of the cable cars stops right outside the hotel which is handy for China Town and getting up all those hills. The rooms were smaller than they look on the promotional material, difficult with two suitcases as there is only a small area to hang clothes up and not anywhere really to put folded clothes. There wasn't a fridge in the room and as I found out with all American hotels there aren't any drinks facilities in the room like tea / coffee. There is a TV in the room. The beds were very good and they pride themselves on being able to choose a multitude of pillows to suit your needs! There can be a bit of noise outside but then again you are on a main street... The reception staff were brilliant, very friendly and knowledgeable, the lady behind the shop / excursions counter is great. By the 3 day travel pass from her, you'd have probably made your money back within a day and a half, you need to use the cable car and trams quite a lot to get around - everyone says San Fran is small but we thought everything was really spaced out plus there are so many hills! You can use the internet for free in the lobby so don't use the one that's available in the room, as you have to pay for that and it's really slow. We tried and then went to reception who told us about the free one and refunded us the charge from the room. We got a reasonable deal on this hotel by booking direct and although you get what you pay for, it's definitely a worthwhile place to stay purely for its location.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":4,"Value":3,"Rooms":3,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":3},"date":"2014-04-14 05:51:43 +0300","author":"Margaret Konopelski"},{"content":"Our initial stay was extended by over a week due to the volcano and we were very happy here.

On subsequent conversations with people about where I would be staying, I discovered that 2 or 3 people I knew had previously stayed there and they raved about the hotel so I was really looking forward to my stay there. I was not disappointed. We stayed for 7 nights in a twin room on the 14th floor. I had emailed the hotel a few days before my arrival to request a high floor if possible â€“ and received a very prompt and personable reply from Kevin, the Reservations Manager. As some others have said, the room was small, but we didnâ€™t need a lot of space, and anyway we spent very little time in the room. The closet was the biggest I have seen and we had our suitcases in there so they were not taking up space. The bathroom was also small, but sufficient. I have a similar sized one myself at home and itâ€™s perfectly adequate. The free wireless internet was a big bonus as you often have to pay for it at more expensive hotels. It worked absolutely fine for me. The internet terminal in Reception is also a great service, as we booked something online that we needed a printer for. All the staff that we dealt with in the hotel were super nice and very efficient. We had an issue where the safe in our room went to â€˜sleepâ€™ twice but when we reported this to reception it was fixed in less than 10 minutes on both occasions. The lady at the tour desk gave some great recommendations for restaurants. Although she did tell us that the Alcatraz night tour that we booked online 3 months earlier didnâ€™t exist which sent us into a bit of a spin, but a phone call to the company quickly sorted that it was in fact running !! We ate breakfast in the hotel a few mornings and it was lovely and the restaurant staff were great. The cookies at reception were delicious, I wish I had started eating them earlier in the week than I did!! The location of the hotel is absolutely fantastic and one of the cable cars runs right outside the door. I loved San Francisco and will certainly be going back sometime in the future.

Staff were extremely helpful and polite. Location was fantastic, so easy to go anywhere. Union Square was nearby, plus shops and many many restaurants. The cable car passed in front of the hotel. The rooms were very comfortable, not huge but still very nice. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel (optional in our booking) as most days we were heading out somewhere different. Great bonus of free tea and coffee in the foyer plus oat biscuits. There is a bar in the foyer and big screen TV. Very close to Chinatown, and the BART station is at the bottom of the street. I actually left a small jewellry conainer in my room and hosuekeeping found it. When I contatcted them they were very good in Fed Exing to our next USA address at our cost.

We had one small issue (that didn't really relate to the hotel) and this was dealt with most professionally - thank you. I really rate the fact that the management of this hotel post responses to comments on this site whether good or bad - it's a sign that they care about both the hotel and their guests. Free coffee/tea in the lobby along with cookies and apples are a nice touch. The beds and amazing pillow selection were very comfortable and so was the room temperature even without A/C. Our family occupied 3 rooms during our stay and reports from all were very good. We would choose to stay again without doubt. Must also give a mention to the Cheesecake Factory opposite (top of Macys) - great food and very reasonable.

The hotel is older, but is in good condition. If you are a big TV person, you may have an issue; there were roughly only about 20 channels and most are news stations. I wasn't in the room enough to really care. I read a few reviews complaining about no air conditioning. First, it says it on their website.

The staff at the desk were very helpful with any questions we had and the little bar had the most devine cocktails ever! We didn't eat there so couldn't comment on that.

They are well soundproofed, decently decorated and very clean. In addition the Chancellor is doing all the extra service right. Coupon for 2 drinks at 1/2 price in room at bar where quiet jazz played. Unexpectedly good breakfast oft an omelette, toast and juice for 2 for only a bit over $25.

If we had stayed longer, I would probably spend more and stay at Hotel Rex again for a bit more room -- paid $105 for Chancellor and $145 for Rex. This would be the perfect place if I was traveling alone -- plenty of room for one person and a great location. Staff were great and we enjoyed those tasty cookies everyone mentions. We asked for a quiet room when we booked and that's exactly what we got. We took the BART to and from the airport -- this cost $10.70 for two people each direction and only took 40 minutes.

Chancellor Hotel is fabulous for both based on its location. If you wish to run on your trip, this is an excellent location. SF running club actually offers 3 routes based on being in Union Square. I did one of them and then made my own. Want to see the Wharf--challenge yourself up Powell and then it is all downhill to the wharf-- then take a right(all flat) and run the piers to return via Market--about 5 miles. Early morning is best, you have the city to yourself! As for the Chancellor--quiet, clean and terribly friendly. I requested late check out and was surprised by the generous time allotted. My room was cleaned one day by Lina--oh my, she is a tidy one--so thorough! The room was more than manageable--the bathroom brought back memories of an apartment I used to occupy built during the same time --very quaint! The complimentary cookies, coffee and tea was so lovely--they even offered soy milk, what a treat for this non milk drinker! I'm very pleased to have stayed at the Chancellor and will frequent it again since I fell in love with the city and must return. A couple of side notes: **if trying to find a gourmet snack or quick lunch--one street up and over (right above the tunnel) there is a liquor/market and it is wonderful. Stocked with great vegan wraps and quick dishes, as well as fresh produce and high end snacks. **want to explore a new church on Sunday--go to Glide which is a few blocks southwest of the hotel. Didn't know going into it, but it is the whose who of San Francisco churches. Glide is Methodist, but it is progressive with almost a full service of various gospel and praise songs. Not for the faint of heart--stand up and clap your hands! The members make you feel very much at home. **take the BART, so easy and cheap at 5.35 a ride from airport to Powell station. **check out the farmer's market on Saturday--great artisans and fresh food. **City Lights bookstore-- a must for any fans of poetry or bookstores of quality!","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2015-05-22 04:43:09 +0300","author":"Jason Shanahan"},{"content":"Stayed there for 10days, the location is excellent, right on union square (ask a room on the back if you don't want to hear the cable car).

Check in : Easy and a friendly. We had requested a refrigerator in the room (based on one of the TA reviewsâ€¦ it really was very useful) Room: Really comfortable for two people. The walk-in closet really expanded the space so that you could store your suitcases and not bump into anything. We had asked for the topmost floor overlooking the Union square, based on TA reviews and were glad for the choice. We weren't bothered by traffic or noise, and in fact found the music filtering in every evening from the Union square really charming. The sound of the cable cars and fire engines wasn't bad enough to disturb our sleep. Bathroom: Slightly on the smaller size, but big enough when we used it one at a time. Wished we had used the comfortable bath-tub (and the rubber duck). Lobby : The hotel lobby is intimate and cosy enough that you welcome coming back after a cool and tiring day. The freshly baked cookies with different types baked everyday (chocolate chip, raisin etc), coffee and apples were appreciated. Infact after the first day, when we had Starbucks, we didn't really feel the need to have any coffee elsewhere. ( I usually obsess over my coffee, and I really liked it). Location: (I hate saying \"location, location, location, location) Great. Just right next to Union square, a hop across to cafes, diners, small bistros, delis, a cable car stop right across, and very convenient for our conference also- just a block across. Staff: Rory, Steve, and the other guys at the reception- very helpful. Any question we had, use of the business center to print our boarding cards, picking up a Fedex for us and calling us up when it came- very helpful. Luques Filling breakfast with cheerful staff (especially Nancy). We had breakfast a day before the conference and it was really good. Bacon usually is too salty to eat, but even an occasional non-vegetarian like me enjoyed it. My wife had the veggie menu and felt her breakfast was ok. Smell: I know somebody had mentioned some smell in the lobby. I didn't really notice any smell except the nice smell of popcorn. There was however some funny smell in the passage outside our room. Just a minor point, and not really a big issue, as the room was comfortable, (non smelly) and the location cant be beaten. Would we come back here- Yes! in a heartbeat..

The entire hotel staff, from the reception desk folks to the bellmen, the concierge, the maintenance personnel, the housekeeping staff and the wait staff and bartenders in Luques, everyone was wonderful. This hotel is beyond words. To our surprise at check-in, we had been upgraded to a suite on the top (15th) floor of the hotel, overlooking Powell Street and Union Square. What a terrific view and location. We thoroughly enjoyed the expansive two room suite, complete with two televisions, two full baths, a large walk-in closet and personal safe. (Thanks Wes for the upgrade and special recognition of our celebrations.) We ate breakfast each morning in Luques Restaurant, attached to the hotel. This was not only convenient, but also provided us with a great start to each day with a fantastic assortment of delicious food. From Brioche French Toast to Praline Pancakes to out-of-this-world omelets, our breakfasts were delightful and very filling. On several occasions, we had the opportunity to imbibe at Luques Bar. Their Mud Slide Martinis and White Russians were fantastic! As many previous reviewers have indicated, the location of The Chancellor can't be beat. We were able to use public transporation to get anywhere and everywhere we wanted to go. The close proximity of the cable cars and Muni rail system really made getting around San Francisco quite easy. While there, being big baseball fans, my wife and I were able to attend two SF Giants games, taking advantage of the Chancellor Hotel SF Giants baseball package promotion. The field level seats provided by the hotel were fantastic.

The location is fantastic.. a short walk to the main shopping area, and easy (right outside the hotel) cable car connections towards Fishermans Wharf. The rooms were recently refurbished, and nicely decorated. Excellent walk-in closet, the bathroom was a little small - but thats hardly a problem! I thought it was great that you could plug your MP3 player into the radio, so that you could listen to your own music. And the nice touch of a pot of sweets was lovely! Coffee/Tea were provided in the hotel lobby free-of-charge so you could just help yourself whenever you fancied one - again a nice touch. Off-site parking is available on Sutter Street (quicker to walk to than drive to!) but none-the-less ideally placed. They also do valet parking there if thats your preference. The only downside really was that there was no AC, and the rooms can get a little warm. Yes, you can open the window, but it does get quite noisy with the cable cars... however after the first night I found I could get used the cable car bells, however the emergency services are not quite so quiet!!! Loved the little bar in the hotel.. only thing it closed at 9.30pm every night we were there... thats pretty early. I believe Friday & Saturday nights it is open later.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff is very professional and courteous. The location is great as it is close to Union Square and the Powell Street Bart Station & Muni stops (Cable Cars, F-Line streetcars, and buses). You can easily walk to the hotel from there. So you can take the BART from either Oakland or San Francisco airport and get off at Powell Street and the hotel is less than 1/3rd of a mile away. The room was comfortable for two people. It was very clean and maintains the charm of an historic building. The bathroom is small with good space utilization. We asked for a room on a higher floor and stayed on the 12th floor (there are 15 floors). You could hear the street noise with the window open but it wasnâ€™t bad at all. I had my laptop with me and the Free WiFi service was easy to use in the room. There is also a computer with an internet connection & printer in the lobby for guests to use. We ate breakfast at the restaurant which had excellent food and service; a great way to start the day. We would definitely stay at the Chancellor again, however due to the lack of air conditioning we would only stay during cooler weather.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2015-01-10 15:20:02 +0300","author":"Scarlett Green Sr."}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lon":-122.4096,"lat":37.7845},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1 415 771-1200","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":"111 Mason St","description":"Hotel Bijou is inspired by San Francisco's rich cinematic history, adorned with movie palace stylings and Hollywood portraits, and features a mini movie theater in the lobby."}

We had a midweek matinee and a good parking deal at the Chancellor, so we decided to go back, which I had hoped to do anyway because of all of the wonderful recent reviews and I wanted to see the room refurbishing. We decided to make it a two night stay. There are two main things which impressed me, especially as compared to the myriad hotels in San Francisco that we have visited over the years. The first is the staff. I swear that the general manager, WesTyler, must have trained this staff in customer relations. Or else they are just genuinely great people...they don't ACT trained, it seems genuine. The front desk clerks are smart, efficient, friendly, and alert. The bellboys keep track of when your room is ready if you arrive early and efficiently keep track of various people's luggage. both checking in and checking out. The woman at the Tour Desk (which we did not use) is available for questions and help...she is probably the equivalent of a 'concierge' in a larger hotel. (She will also laugh with you when you come in from the rain soaking wet.) The staff in the restaurant is not only efficient and attentive, but cheery and fun. They really seem to enjoy what they are doing and always wish you a good day when you leave. If you run into a member of the housekeeping staff in the hallway as you are entering or leaving your room, you can always count on a greeting with a smile, ...\"good morning\"...for example. The refurbished rooms are delightful, with a classy decor, beds and linens and comforters you wish you could take home with you. SO....this is an older hotel, brought up to boutique/charming style. Don't expect 300 square foot rooms, air conditioning, huge modern bathrooms. You may find a welcome walk-in closet. You will not have air-conditioning, but you will have a window which opens and a ceiling fan to circulate the air. Actually, you will need not to worry about A/C at all in SF. You will need to worry about heat, if you are in your room during the day on cold days. The hotel has an efficient way of turning on the heat at about 5 o'clock in the evening and turning it off later in the morning, but if you are in your room during the day and get cold, look in your walk-in closet you will find a modern electric 120 v \"radiator\" which you can trot out to warm your toes. It is not really a problem, just a caution for extra cold days if you plan to \"stay in\". OKAY, Wes.....your turn. But please share what I said about your staff with them. They are truly incredible.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2015-04-11 20:42:46 +0300","author":"Marcos Kassulke"},{"content":"Stayed with family (incl 2 teenagers) for 3 nights in December - fantastic location near Union Square, amazing value and super friendly and helpful staff.

The attractions are in order of attactiveness: location, staff attitude, quietness. The location works for most of the Market/business dist area and I stay here for Moscone conferences as well. The place is consistently well staffed by people who notice you and ask if they can help in a proactive fasion. The rooms are a bit small, but that's what you get with an older property. And with an older property you also get more solid and quiet construction. I found most of the fixtures in the room of higher than average quality. Everything worked in my rooms there. There is no exercise equipment there, but I never care in SFO since it's a walkers paradise. While the property itself doesn't have some of the things I usually associate with an excellent rating, the location and value of this hotel combined with the consistent service level propels to this level.","ratings":{"Overall":5},"date":"2015-09-22 06:28:14 +0300","author":"Cleve Grimes"},{"content":"The first time I stayed at The Chancellor was in Dec. 1990 when I went Christmas shopping with three friends. We stayed at other hotels in and around Union Square during the past 17 years and they were OK. Living in the Central Valley we are frequent visitors to San Francisco. I came back to The Chancellor by a twist of fate. My mother, aunt and sister from New York wanted to visit San Francisco in September after attending my son's wedding. When we were talking about it, my aunt found a an index card my uncle (now deceased)had typed with information about The Chancellor. It had a hand written note on it that I liked it. On a fluke, we called the phone number on the card and sure enough the reservation clerk at The Chancellor answered in person. Same phone number 17 years later and a real live person!!! No recording!!! We booked a room for my husband and myself and suite for my mom, my aunt and my sister right next to us on the 15th floor. We had a wonderful time! The staff is top notch, so courteous and helpful. We love the extra touches of coffee, tea, cookies, fruit, newspapers 24-hours 7 days a week. Luques Restaurant has delicious food and superb Eggs Benedict ... Yum.... During the Sept. trip I booked a suite for the Dec. 1 and 2, 2007 for myself and my three Christmas shopping friends. This time we got the suite on the 14th floor, which is in the back of the hotel and much quieter. We had a fantastic weekend and really got into the Christmas spirit!!! We did lots of shopping, eating, walking ....and laughing at Beach Blanket Babylon!! My friend wants to go back to SFO in January and already booked another hotel down the street.

It exceeded our expectations for three-star hotels in every way. We've stayed in other hotels in the same Union Square neighborhood before but think this is certainly the best value. We were able to get a \"parking package\" which is critical for this area of San Francisco -- parking rates can be as high as $38 a day. The parking lot was just 1/2 block away which was another nice change from the other neighborhood hotels we've stayed in. The room was a little small, but obviously recently remodeled and even had a view. The bed was wonderful and the bathroom was small but sparkling clean (yes, it had a tub). One caveat: the hotel is on a boiler system, so there's no heat available until late at night. The hotel gave us a portable radiator that kept us warm until the building heat kicked on. The lobby has free coffee, newspapers and cookies. We enjoyed the breakfast at the small restaurant, Lucques. The staff was friendly and helpful.

Upon checking in I was issued with 4 free travel tickets for the trams, which were readily used. The bed was very comfortable and the room clean and pleasant to stay in, this was important as my daughter being so young needed to be in bed by 8.00. The rooms were not the largest I have stayed in, but were cosy. The restaurant was fine (decent breakfast) as was the bar, but being with child we could not utilize to their full potential.

I booked this hotel on the recommendation of other Trip Advisors. The Chancellor Hotel, was in a great location, had friendly staff and went out of their way to assist in all of our requests. We had three rooms booked as there were six in our group. All three rooms, while small and old, were clean and had everything we required. The free apples, cookies, coffee and internet access were a nice touch. Their tour desk was helpful and booked several things for us quickly and efficiently - they sell stamps and postcards (get the postcards down the street for 1/2 the price) they even posted our postcards for us. For the price, service and location, I would definitely recommend the Chancellor. While there are beggars on the street nearby, they did not hassle us and I felt safe at all times, even late at night. The street is busy, full of people, cheapish eateries and the cable car stop is directly outside the front door of the hotel. The hotel staff recommended a great Italian restuarant, so it's worth asking their advice on where to eat. The shopping in the area is great, with big brands and a huge Westfield about 5 minutes down the street. It's a hotel where they take an interest in their guests. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2012-05-13 10:58:11 +0300","author":"Isaias Thiel"},{"content":"My husband and I stayed at the Chancellor for 5 nights (7-12 September 07). This was our second visit, and part of an anniversary trip, so I contacted Wes the manager before we travelled and he helped me to arrange a special treat for our arrival. Not only did we find a bottle of wine and a special gift for our anniversary, but some beers and nuts for my husband (he is a simple pleasures kind of guy!) The hotel room (1103) was great - we had a corner view of Union Square, and although we could hear the cable cars quite clearly, they just added to the experience of San Francisco. We purchased a pair of MUNI passes from the tour desk and made full use of them during our stay. We travelled regularly on the cable cars (which were quite busy, but another part of the San Fran experience). We also walked down to Market Street and caught the F Line historic trams, which go all the way along the Embarcadero to Fisherman's wharf. Top tip - take the $20 trip across the Golden Gate Bridge - it only takes 1 and a half hours, but you get to stop off at the Palace of Fine Arts and take pictures of the city from the other side of the bridge. We also took a $10 sunset cruise under the bridge, which was well worth the money, if a little chilly!! Anyway, back to the hotel - I didn't get the chance to meet Wes in person to thank him for his help in making our stay special, but I didn't really have the need to speak to any of the staff apart from at check-in, as we had no problems the entire duration of our stay. That said, whenever we made our way through the entrance foyer, we were always hailed with a greeting by whoever was on the check-in desk. Little things like that, along with the jars of sweets and rubber ducky, made our second stay at the Chancellor just as good, if not better, than our first. We had no reason to stay anywhere else when we came on this trip, and we still have no reason to change on our next visit.

Yes, it is old and small but having stayed in lots of city hotels around the world where space is at a premium it is only to be expected. The location makes it worth it. Very central and the tram stopping outside the hotel makes a fun addition for tourists. I can't believe the guy below who thought a $10 note would get him respect. First because it is not required here - all the staff were great; helpful and friendly and there were always lots of front desk staff and porters around who helped us for no consideration and second because he's so cheap!!! Small, quirky shaped (in our case) rooms but very clean and comfortable and quiet. With an average temperature around the 70s AC is really not required; and the fan was adequate. Some recommendations regarding eating - hotel breakfast was very good and reasonably priced but we enjoyed Lorie's diner (one just up the road and one just down the road) - great fun and very efficient - the kids loved it. We ate at the restaurant next door which sometimes had long queues (forgotten the name) but it was very disappointing (dull American fixed menu - sorry) and service was poor - 10 minute wait at the bar for a table but no bar service and no wine list offered at the table. There was one but it took so long to get it the food was delivered! The Italian restaurant opposite the hotel was the fantastic - we didn't book a table (advised) but as we were early (6pm) and agreed to eat within the hour we got a table. Really great food served by friendly staff and the same price as the other restaurant. Wish I hadn't been with children as it had a very buzzy cocktail bar section and it looked fun. A find which was only a short 5 mins walk away was a small,classy but again reasonably priced French restaurant called Anjou. Off the beaten track but I'm sure the hotel staff can direct you.

After doing research on the internet I felt like the Chancellor was the hotel for me. The location is the best - right on the cable car line and right in the middle of great shopping and restaurants. Yes, the rooms are on the small size but I didn't come to San Francisco to stay iin my room. I was usually out and on the go by 8:00 each morning and did't get back to late in the evening. I did not have any trouble with the walls being too thin. The beds were very comfortable and the large bathtub was great. I did not eat in the hotel restaurant but did enjoy the cookies and coffee in the lobby. Everytime I had a question about the city I found the front desk to be very courteous and helpful. I had a wonderful time in SF and if I go there again, I will stay at the Chancellor without a doubt.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":4,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2013-06-10 11:18:15 +0300","author":"Katelyn Waters"},{"content":"We think the Chancellor Hotel is great value for money in an unbeatable location.

The hotel was really good value and in a superb location just minutes away from Union Square. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was small but decor was good, bed very comfortable and bathroom fine. A 'walk-in' cupboard was useful for stashing cases and had a safe, ironing board and iron and a portable heater for chilly nights. Just a few yards away was Lori's Diner which was fun and inexpensive and the Sears restaurant with the 'world famous l8 pancake breakfast'! Great shopping in the area and the new mall Westfield had an elegant Nordstrum store with a curving escalator right up to the lounge beneath the dome on the 4th floor with comfy seats for a rest between shopping. For those with less to spend try Ross a few stores along for real bargains - also Kaplans govt. surplus store which sells genuine Levi 501's for $27. Don't miss a short walk to Maiden Lane to see a fabulous Frank Lloyd Wright building, and a walk around Chinatown - choose the 'gift supermarket' to buy your souvenirs at rock bottom prices with nobody hassling you. Keep a few dollars available for the homeless beggars who sell the newsheet on the streets in this area.","ratings":{"Overall":5},"date":"2014-11-12 07:19:10 +0300","author":"Jovanny Kautzer"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-122.4181,"lat":37.783},"free_breakfast":false,"email":"phoenixhotel@jdvhotels.com","phone":"+1 415 776-1380","vacancy":false,"free_parking":false,"price":"$119-$169","address":"601 Eddy St","description":"A boutique hotel, favored by musicians of all stripes, with free parking and breakfast."}

I recommend the parking valet because it's much easier. I had called a couple days before to request a room away from the elevators. I was given a nice room in the back on the 12th floor. It was a good size and comfortable. I kept forgetting to step up into the bathroom and I thought it was a little small. But the shower pressure was great and the tub was deep. If I had time, I would have soaked in the tub. In the morning, there was the basic hum of the city, but nothing major. Maybe on the Powell St. side, it was noisier, but that's the charm of San Francisco. The staff is incredibly nice. It's in a great location and the cookies and coffee in the lobby are an added treat. Also, this was the first hotel that I've been to that offered an umbrella to use in case of rain. I will be staying here again, and again, in the future.

When I advised Mr Tyler that it was our honeymoon, without hesitation he upgraded our room to a suite and 'threw in' a Romantic Package aswell (as detailed on the website). The room was of good size and the room was cleaned promptly on a daily basis. We had no problem with any frustrating noises - just the sound of the bustling San Francisco streets below. As other reviews have mentioned, the hotel is ideally located on Union Square, with great access to the whole of San Francisco via various modes of transport. Also good restaurants within walking distance - in all directions ! The coffee and cookies within the reception area, are a lovely touch, which we enjoyed....maybe too often ! We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to friends/family - indeed we already have. If you are wanting 5* luxury within a large corporate chain, Hilton, Radisson, etc - this is not the hotel for you.

It is nice old style city hotel with the benefit of some modern conveniences such as movies on demand and wireless internet in the rooms.

The staff can't do enough for you, especially in the bar where they showed genuine interest in our day, recommended restaurants and routes and helped us try out a few new cocktails. You can use the internet for a dollar for as long as you want if nobody else is waiting. There is coffee available all day for the jetlagged to wander down and collect at 5am if they can't sleep. The free cookies tasted fab, loved the rubber duck in the bath and the pillow menu. The foot spa rental after a day of sightseeing is inspired. In summary, don't go for luxury - its clean, functional, quirky, comfortable but, for me, the friendliness of all the staff and the ability to pop back in the afternoons for a rest and a free cuppa, plus the wonderfully central location made this a bargain gem and really made our holiday.","ratings":{"Overall":5},"date":"2015-11-05 18:49:13 +0300","author":"Dr. Beatrice Fadel"},{"content":"I stayed in the Chancellor for four nights in September.

Worried a bit that these reviews are overblown, but not having a better option, I went with the sites recomendations and landed on the Chancellor. For others reading this I can now say 'rest easy' there is little risk with the Chancellor. I travel a lot and stay in all kinds of hotels all over the country. What I say next comes from 65 - 80 nights on the road per year. The Chancellor is not 'perfect' but if your goal is to find a safe, clean, friendly place, with professional staff in a great location and at a price that allows you to focus your resources on seeing the City and doing the other things without feeling buyers remorse, then this place will meet that goal. This hotel is older (1914), designed and built in a different era. It lacks the modern uniformity and the cookie cutter design approach of a Westin or Hyatt or Hilton. Hallways are narrow and twist and turn. The elevator is small, older and a bit slow for a traveling type 'A' like me, but hey, use the steps to go down. With that said, this hotel is as clean and quiet if not cleaner and a more quiet hotel than that of the larger more expensive hotel chains found elsewhere. Rooms are smallish but at this price do what we did, get two adjoining rooms. Room for all !! Great rest - beds are clean and comfortable - at a very good price. Great Location. Can walk around as its a safe area - a few beggars perhaps, but this is a large American city not unlike any other large American city in that regard. Easy acess to cable cars, taxis and BART - no need for a car while in the City. Fun tip : Rent the \"Blazing Saddle\" bikes and ride across the GG Bridge. Yolanda the desk person ( who assisted with our extra nights stay ) and Matt the Bellman ( who secured me an extra rubber duck) were names I recall for service.

It is very homelike. They have a wine/food get together in the late afternoon and a truly homemade breakfast that is one of the best I've seen. The downside? Well the bathroom isn't anything fancy. If you like a nice tub this won't do. But you do have access to a nice fitness center and two hot tubs. Also, they need to upgrade the mattresses. These are old style, with too much wiggle.

I guess that begins with the fact that the rooms are actually below the lobby - you feel like you are going back to the parking garage. We had a King/Spa room - the highest category. It was large and decently appointed. The fireplace was nice. We had a view of the courtyard - which was fine. But, for what we paid, I would have rather spent $50 more and stayed down the street at Hotel 1000 in one of their Executive Rooms. We found it strange that a boutique hotel wouldn't have wine glasses in the room - and when we called to request them, we were told we could retrieve them ourselves from the breakfast room. The breakfast room reminded my of the common area in a Holiday Inn Express or something of that caliber. Other reviewers are correct in that parking is difficult to navigate - you want directions. You not only get physical keys, but also 2 fobs for the garage and buidling access - it's quite a handful. Do ask for a quiet room - there are a couple that appear to be right under the viaduct exit. And, the heater is annoying as it turns itself on and off repeatedly all night long. All that said, the location at the Steps and near the market was nice. We probably won't stay there again, but it was decent.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":2,"Value":2,"Rooms":3,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":2},"date":"2014-12-16 02:02:43 +0300","author":"Kamron Douglas"},{"content":"We stayed at Inn at Harbor Steps on a recent get-a-way to Seattle, WA.

An apologetic email eventually came back together with confirmation of booking. I also requested an early check-in but on our arrival at 10am after an overnight train journey we were not even provided with a room in which to freshen up. The hotel is part of a much larger apartment complex and is very strangely set up, sharing its facilities with the apartments but having its own separate reception desk tucked away in a corner. To get from reception to your room you have to go outside, across an open walkway, down an external staircase or in a public access lift which can be operated only with a key â€“ in fact, you are given no less than 3 keys!!!! The room was standard US hotel but had a pleasant enough balcony overlooking the harbour (yes, there's a 'u' in harbour) steps and the monstrosity of the waterfront elevated highway. Service was courteous but rarely more than than, breakfasts are served in a windowless room somewhere in the basement but a more pleasant afternoon happy hour (with unlimited wine and nibbles) can be enjoyed in the library. Where this hotel does score highly in my book is its location, diagonally opposite the Seattle Art Gallery, 5 mins from Pike Street Market, 2 mins from the waterfront and perhaps a 10 min walk from Pioneer Square. Otherwise, it was a bland â€˜corporateâ€™ feel hotel that has to be ranked last of all the hotels we stayed in during our 3 week tour of the US and Canada.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":1,"Value":2,"Rooms":3,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":4},"date":"2014-04-12 05:43:09 +0300","author":"Alivia Tillman"},{"content":"A friend recommended this hotel to us.

Our rate was $175 ( plus $15.58 tax) per night. For that we got a large room and a nice breakfast buffet with both hot and cold food, along with an afternoon \"tea\" (wine) in the \"library.\" You might describe the place as sort of an impersonal B & B. The location is right smack in downtown Seattle just a couple of blocks from Pike Place Market, so you can walk most anywhere you'd like in the downtown (though Seattle is hilly, if you've never been there). (We did not have a car, so I cannot comment on the parking alternatives if you do have your own car.) The \"Inn\" is actually two lower levels, below street level on the uphill side, of a large, fairly modern apartment building. The furnishings are a little spare, sort of \"Pottery Barnish,\" but everything was clean and most everything worked well (thankfully a plunger was located next to the toilet). You enter a common reception lobby (no more) shared by the Inn guests and the apartment dwellers. There are two desks. One of the left for the apartments and one on the right for the Inn. There is no mixing these businesses. The appartment desk will not \"give you the time of day\" if you're there for the Inn. We figured that out pretty quickly. The Inn desk was very nice, however. We'd go back at the $175 price, which is much less than traditional hotels in the area. It's a good deal, given the location, assuming all you're looking for is a nice, clean, comfortable, quite room and a buffet breakfast before you head out on city.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":3,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4,"Check in / front desk":4},"date":"2012-01-08 09:10:29 +0300","author":"Thalia Monahan"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lon":-122.4132,"lat":37.808},"free_breakfast":false,"email":"rhi_sffw@radisson.com","phone":"+1 415 392-6700","vacancy":true,"free_parking":true,"price":"$190-$400","address":"250 Beach St","description":"Nice hotel, centrally located (only two blocks from Pier 39).

Hotel provides free breakfast (eggs, waffles, cereal, fruit, oatmeal, etc.). Rooms are clean and average - small from a suite perspective. I was able to walk from the hotel straight down Stewart Street to the Fish Market in 15 minutes (but I walk fast). There are better\\cheaper hotels closer to downtown and free bus stops.

Every hotel employee we talked to seemed really friendly and eager to help with our questions. I was amazed in this day and age. The L-shaped hotel pool is tiny, but looked like fun for kids, and there is a hot-tub and exercise room as well. Breakfast was indeed abundant. We could make our own waffles, then add scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and fruit. Also available were bagels, muffins, oatmeal, yogurt--just about everything you could have wanted. One morning there was sort of a long line, waiting to make waffles, and then waiting for scrambled eggs. But that's being picky. Our room was really nice (we asked for one away from the freeway after reading reviews here earlier) and it was still a bit noisy, but hey, it's the city. It felt like a deluxe room, considering the reasonable price, with nice bedding and even art on the walls that we really liked. We could even see the Space Needle a bit from our window. The shuttle runs hourly, so it wasn't as though we could reserve it to go to a certain place at a certain time. But it worked out well for us, and when the shuttle missed us by just a minute when we needed to return from the Space Needle, they promptly paid our cab fare without my even having asked. We will definitely go back when we have a need to stay near downtown Seattle again.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2012-01-19 03:26:12 +0300","author":"Avery O'Conner"},{"content":"We bought two nights at this hotel through an online site that does not disclose what the hotel is but only the rating before booking, (hotwire I think...)

First, I called a week before explaining that my single occupancy had to be changed since I had a friend coming to stay with me. They immediately made the change for me with no additional fees. One of the main reasons I chose Hotel Deca was because of it's close proximity to the Neptune Theater. I had plans to see a concert there, and it's across the street. When we arrived, we met with Front Desk clerk Emily. She was friendly and personable, and made sure that we had a room with a great view of the city skyline. Later, we learned that they had a shuttle service, and another clerk suggested we eat at Ivar's Salmon House for dinner. He drove us there, and later picked us up. The dinner was delicious. The next day, we met with another clerk Ryan. He, also, was very helpful in providing suggestions on where to go. Our room was great! Clean, spacious, and comfortable. The only downside is that taxi service from the airport to the hotel ranges up to $50-60. Hotel Deca does have a car service which comes at a flat rate of $50. The car service was prompt, and the driver was very friendly. I do recommend that you call ahead of time to make arrangements for the service. Overall, it was a fantastic stay, and I wish I could have stayed longer. If I make another trip to Seattle, Hotel Deca will be my hotel of choice.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2015-02-04 08:27:13 +0300","author":"Kurtis Hackett"},{"content":"We stayed at the Hotel Deca last week for 4 nights and had our son's rehearsal dinner in the Governor room.

There were lots of restaurants close by. This part of Seattle was not a \"garden\" spot - streets dirty, creepy people, but Deca was immaculate, safe, an oasis in that part of town. Providing transportation from the airport would have been helpful since they have the shuttle and seem to go to other places in town. But, we were able to park our rental van there at no charge.

Tully's is adjacent to the hotel and convenient for coffee in the morning, since there is no coffee maker in the room and breakfast is not included. Rooms are nicely decorated, modern style, comfortable beds and very clean. My main gripe is that the shuttle is COMPLETELY unreliable. They make a list of who needs to go where and at what time, but they don't use the list. They booked too many people at the same time and it was a big cluster trying to get a group of about 10 people to and from our conference. They basically told everyone to just show up at a certain time but there was not enought room for everyone in the van. In addition, one lady had to wait over an hour at night, in the rain, to get picked up at the Space Needle after dinner -- when she was told the shuttle would be coming shortly. This place if fine in every respect but don't hold your breath on the shuttle. They have a parking lot where you can park your car for free - and you may want to plan on driving your own car around or catching a cab instead of relying on the shuttle. The front desk staff were young and not helpful in making restaurant recommendations - and certainly not helpful with arranging the shuttle. The District Lounge restaurant/bar in the basement of the restaurant had good food but very slow service. There was live music in The Lounge most nights.

Since I was exhausted I decided to take a short nap---and short it was indeed, because a teenaged girl began shrieking and running through the hallway outside of our room. To the hotel's credit, a security staffer came up and instructed the girls to stay in their room, but shortly after he left, the aforementioned girl was out giggling and running in the hallway. When I went down for dinner, I commented to the desk clerk about our noisy neighbors, and she said, \"Sometimes things like that happen.\" I was speechless, but took that as a cue to seek dinner outside of the building. (The Deca has a small bistro in its basement, where we had lunch: the service was friendly, but the food was an overpriced disappointment. A small piece of grilled salmon was served over a large bed of lightly sauteed sliced onions and peppers. With 2 drinks, the total tab for the two of us came to over $30, and we left hungry. I also might add this hotel has no room service, so forget about breakfast in bed or late-night munchies in front of the flatscreen plasma TV that was in our premium room.) This is too bad, as the room we stayed in was pleasantly decorated and had plenty of space. We had a view of the city from our window, and the hotel is located very close to the University of Washington, where I was visiting. There is also free off-street parking, which is a lot to recommend in a town where parking averages $7 an hour. However, we were disappointed by the noise we could hear in our room. On one side we could hear our neighbors' television, while on the other, shrieking and giggling. Maybe a less noise-phobic guest would like this place: but I really need quiet to sleep well, so I didn't. Beware too, that the free continental breakfast is cleared away at 9 a.m. sharp---something that wasn't mentioned anywhere in the room---so you will miss out if you like sleeping in. I have to say I have visited Seattle many times and have stayed at several different hotels; I don't think I want to go back to this one. There are quieter places with far more amenities in that city.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":3,"Value":2,"Rooms":4,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3,"Check in / front desk":3},"date":"2013-12-26 20:16:56 +0300","author":"Rupert Crist"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lon":-122.4285,"lat":37.8071},"free_breakfast":false,"email":"info@norcalhostel.com","phone":"+1 415 771-7277","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":"Dorms: $26-$30 Private family rooms: $65-$100","address":"Fort Mason, Building 240","description":"Even if you're unsure about hostels, you should still consider this place; the location alone makes it worth your while, as it is in a park-like setting with great views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz and is within easy walking distance of [[San Francisco/Fisherman's Wharf|Fisherman's Wharf]].

Having always used Marriott in previous trips, I decided to venture out from the norm and book the Regency. Upon entering, I was immediately intrigued by the elegance of the building and decor. Every employee I encountered always had a smile on their face and was willing to help. The staff was very knowledgeable on the surrounding city and I often utilized their advice for restaurants and things to do. Even the bell staff was willing to answer questions about directions and such and were always one step ahead in opening the doors and helping with bags. I was very impressed. The room we stayed in was gorgeous. We were on the 19th floor overlooking the city. The views were breathtaking. Waking up in the morning and looking out over the surrounding area was a pleasant experience. The architecture of the hotel was also impressive. Stepping off the elevator, there was an atrium that was three floors tall. Instead of walking out into a narrow and claustrophobic hallway, we were greeted with a sitting area complete with artwork and statues. Normally, hotels focus their main decorating on the lobby. But this hotel had all the right touches in all the right places. The beds were one of a kind. I have never felt so rested before. Everything about this hotel will make me want to choose Hyatt in the future. I forget exactly what the nightly rate was, but it was definitely worth every penny. The fitness center was well-equipped and the pool was very nice, complete with sauna, steam room, locker room, showers, and rest room. The restaurants also looked very good, but I did want to leave the hotel to walk around. Next time I will definitely dine in the restaurants. The only downside was the expensive parking garage.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2012-10-22 11:25:47 +0300","author":"Gavin Hilpert"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-118.413193,"lat":34.066632},"free_breakfast":false,"email":null,"phone":"+1-310-274-7777","vacancy":false,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":"9876 Wilshire Blvd","description":"Walk to Rodeo, enjoy the restaurants along the way.

Positioned right on the Grand Canal with fabulous views, the main entrance is hidden down a gorgeous walkway ....one minute from a very regularly serviced waterbus terminal. We must have commented at least five times a day how grateful we were for the hotels location ... away from the crowds yet in the most perfect location. Our room (110) could not have been better. We were a little dissapointed not to have scored a canal view but in hindsight were grateful for the cool, quiet courtyard view in the end. High ceilings, stunning interior design, gorgeous linens, outstanding housekeeping and all the little touches you expect from a five star hotel. Whilst the architecture of the building, luxurious interiors, commanding position and AMAZING breakfast buffet (with terrace tables right on the canal) are worth mentioning, the real difference is the staff. How refreshing to see the same faces everyday. Be remembered, warmly welcomed 'home' after a long hot day and given your room key without having to mention the room number or never having to sign for anything. Its little touches like that which make this truly five star ...including the prompt delivery of a chilled glass of milk at 11pm when I coudlnt sleep! Did I mention the chocolate dipped strawberries and prosecco on arrival? All this indulgence, three nights (including breakfast) for a very reasonable 800 Euro. We're well travelled and rely heavily on Tripadvisor for recommendations.

However, the receptionist redeemed the hotel by swiftly moving us into a junior suite - 402- on the same floor. Huge room, fab bathroom & 15ft high windows with panoramic views of the Grand Canal. Breakfast is excellent - a huge selection of hot and cold dishes, fresh fruit, pastries, good coffee and Prosecco too. The waiting staff were charming and attentive.

We decided to splash out on a suite with Grand Canal view and a separate standard room for our daughter, booked through the SINA hotels website at the introductory rate. I had called to check the two rooms would be close to each other, and was assured that they would be 'face to face'. When we arrived by water taxi from the airport, I was slightly disappointed to see that the hotel was clearly undergoing maintenance - the manhole cover in the courtyard was up, with hazard barriers around it, and there was an alarming smell of sewage. Workmen had erected a workbench in the corner of the courtyard and were busy sawing up pipes with a circular saw (rather noisy!). In the passageway to the restaurant, the bar was covered in clear plastic as there was clearly work in that area too. Not a great way to start, though the reception staff were very welcoming and the reception area is stunning. We were then shown to our rooms on the fourth floor Again, the maintenance issues were very clear, as there was a bucket on the floor by the lift and the skirting board of the passageway had been removed - we asked what the problem was and were told that there were some issues with the air conditioning. The suite was stunning, with full length windows overlooking the Grand Canal, 2 small balconies (don't think you could sit out on them - standing room only!!!) and a mezzanine sleeping area. Slightly strange decoration but very luxurious. Bathroom was upstairs behind the bed in the sleeping area - a small bath with shower in it, single sink and separate toilet room (with no sink) on the other side of the bed. Very attractive, but unfortunately the gold leaf finish has really suffered from contact with water in places. You can see why when you start the shower - the water goes everywhere, even if you are careful. But all in all, a very attractive room, with automatic curtains so you can just lie in bed in the morning and push a button to see the view of the canal (and people breakfasting at the hotel opposite). Our daughter's room was at the back of the hotel with only a very limited view out of the back over the rooftops and one window with a view of a wall. Not great but what you expect in Venice if you don't pay a premium for Grand Canal view. Her bathroom was actually nicer than ours, with double sink and far more spacious. Again, the gold leaf finish wasn't holding up well. As we had been told, her room was very close to ours - diagonally across the hallway. The only problem was the key system, as she found it very difficult to open the door to her room - you had to hold the key to the pad and push the door at the same time. The door was very stiff and she found it really hard to get in without one of us to help her. We had a lovely night's sleep in these rooms (very dark and incredibly quiet given the location) and a great first day in Venice - starting with a fabulous breakfast at the hotel's restaurant. We battled for a table outside - there are about six on the deck over the canal, so if the hotel is full I'd imagine you'd be more likely to be inside, which is nice but not really as special as eating on the Grand Canal. Great spread of food and even Prosecco if you're not in a hurry to do anything (we weren't!!). Only thing to beware of is the seagulls - if you leave your table for even a moment they will swoop down and eat your food. We saw this happen to a couple of tables - predictably our daughter thought it was hilarious! When we got back to our rooms in the afternoon, we noticed that there was a puddle of water in the doorway to our suite. It turned out that the air conditioning was leaking. After much consultation, the maintenance team concluded that we'd have to move rooms. We were told that we'd be moving to 2 interconnecting junior suites on the second floor ('at no charge' - 'I should hope not!'). We packed up and the staff helped us move all our things. The two new rooms were lovely - with the same ceiling height as the suite but without the mezzanine. Again, full length windows over the Grand Canal and very luxurious. One was decorated in rich reds and the other in orange (or umber perhaps?). The bathrooms were far more spacious than the one in the suite, and again had the same issues with the gold leaf and a very leaky shower in one. We had to make a dam out of towels to have any hope of avoiding a total flood. Beds were fabulous and curtains made the rooms lovely and dark in the mornings. The fact that they were interconnecting would have made them a far better choice than our original rooms, as we didn't have to worry about our daughter letting herself out of her room and getting stranded in the corridor. In summary, potentially a great hotel - fabulous location (2 minutes from the traghetto over the Grand Canal, 2 minutes from the Guggenheim etc.), great service and spacious (for Venice!), modern rooms. However, I can't see the bathrooms lasting long without a total revamp, and they obviously need to sort out the A/C issues - they had to turn it off entirely for repairs on the morning we checked out, which with temperatures in the 30s outside wasn't ideal. If they sort out these issues I can't think of anywhere I'd rather stay in Venice.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Value":4,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-02-23 15:22:13 +0300","author":"Joanny Barton"},{"content":"Next door to the Mayo Clinic the room comes with a small kitchen, couch, Wifi, desk and king bed.

I needed directions to my destination but didn't have a printer (and no, my phone is not so \"smart') so I asked the person on site for help. Not only did he print out the information, he also researched and printed out an alternate route that he thought might be more helpful. Very nice, very considerate.

The only problem I had was parking the rental car, but the Prudential building one block away (2 minutes) had plenty of safe parking at $39 per day. Very close to the 'T' station on the green line, and in the Back Bay area - walkable to Copley Square and as far as Boston Common. The Prudential building had good shopping malls with numerous restaurants; there is a 7 Eleven store opposite the hotel and Shaw's is 5 minutes away. With the studio room having its own kitchenette (fridge/freezer, microwave, coffee maker, toaster oven, two ring electric hob and even a waste disposer), one could have cooked if one wanted - and great for snacks etc. A basic breakfast is available downstairs in the small lounge from 7 to 11am, with a large-screen Apple for internet access; hot coffee, cold juice & yogurt, toasted muffins and bagels set you up for the day. Tom the manager couldn't have been more helpful and friendly - his staff are on duty until 10pm in the office, and available later by telephone. One (small) minus - the hotel opened in the fall of 2008 after a major refit, but is an characterful 'brownstone' building with wood floors; it's a matter of showing consideration for the other HOUSE guests, for that is what we were - the room is serviced when required, but will be left for up to 8 days if not required - perfect for that late sleep-in after traveling! Air conditioning kept us warm, but fresh air was also good in the quiet neighborhood. A first-class experience of US hospitality and a 'boutique' hotel! Thanks, Tom; you made our stay great.

The room was beautiful, very large bed, hugh flat screen, nice bathroom and even a kitchen (we didn't use that but still it was nice).

The reception is clean and welcoming and the reception staff were extremely helpful, not only with the rooms but also in providing maps, advice on travel and sightseeing and booking tickets. The rooms were nice, we had a top floor attic-style room. The room was clean, roomy and fairly well equipped, it had all we neeed as somewhere to sleep, shower and dress. Breakfast was fine, it was the usual mix of breads, pastries, cold meats and cheeses plus scrambled eggs and sausages, plus drinks, toast etc, all on a self service buffet basis. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant so we can't comment on this, as you'd expect there are hundreds of places to eat all around the city We loved Barcelona and if we go back there again we would definitely book the San Agustin again.

Venice is truly one of the unique places in the world to visit and most of its hotels are unique as well. The general rule for the upper end Venice hotels is pretty expensive, good service, dramatic facades and lobbies, followed by individual rooms that are small, dated and quite uninspiring. The Charming House IQ truly breaks this mold. The unmarked entrance off the canal is picture book, opening to a small lobby. There is no grand lobby or public area. Guests are given a set of keys to the iron gate fronting the piazza and the heavy wooden unmarked door which opens to a private courtyard. We had a two room suite with 2 in each room and a private entry to each room. The larger room contained a small kitchen area and a full sized living room. Sharing this space was the best of all worlds. Furnishings were urban upscale (think W hotel) as a opposed to old and stuffy. Rooms and the bathrooms are huge by Venice standards. The staff was fabulous. Extremely helpful. They set the table each morning in our living room and catered in a nice continental breakfast and brought ice for evening drinks.

The kitchen was lacking basic equipment like paper towels, dish soap or dish cloths, and maid service never cleaned our kitchen at all. Both days we came back at 4 pm and the rooms still had not been cleaned. There was loud banging all night from the kitchen/bar below, and pounding music 2 out of 3 nights well past 2 am. The shag carpet was disgusting, and the wifi did not work well. The towels were old and stained, and they didn't provided enough until our last day. They tried to charge us $479 per night, way over the quoted rate on the phone. After getting no sleep the first night we complained, and they immediately reduced the rate $100 (to the originally quoted price). After the last night of noise and having to phone front desk to complain, they took another $80 off the total bill. A nice gesture, but does not make up for the lack of sleep we experienced on this trip. I'm all for retro hotels, but under no circumstances would I recommend this one to friends.

The Hotel is situated in a slightly shabby area and the 10 minute walk to the main street for trams etc is steep and quite hazardous with some steps, in poor repair, and watch out for open holes leading to shops in cellars! I wouldn't advise walking down there in the dark, if only for that reason. The hotel is very clean and our room was completely new, we were the first occupants. The bathroom had an all singing, all dancing shower cubicle, spa and massage features etc. Our only criticism, it was a bit small, perhaps should have been a single rather than a double and whilst being next to the dining room has some advantages, the noise from it is not one of them. Breakfast is reasonable and the restaurant serves good, inexpensive food if you don't want to venture out at night.

We have 5 and 3 year old boys and they loved it all. There were several good things and several not-so-good things I will list below. Good: -Our room (3333) was in the Tower and was a very nice room that was clean and spacious. It was a handicapped room so they might be why it was large, I am not certain. The bathroom was huge and we had a mini-fridge and a table. There was a sink in the bathroom and a vanity outside the bathroom with a large mirror, hair dryer, etc. The kids loved the bunk beds and we loved the king bed. I would not want to stay in the other building as it is quite a distance, especially in the winter. -They have a restaurant on-site with decent, reasonably priced food. This allowed us to not have to leave the park. It also has room service, though we did not use it. -The water park was lots of fun for my kids and we had fun, too. They have stuff inside and outside, and there were plenty of towels, life jackets, seats/tables. It was clean, too. There were three shallow kid pools and 2 deeper adult pools, a lazy river, and 2 slides. -They allow you to stay and play until close on the day you check out (10pm), and there is a shower in the restroom by the pools so you can clean up and head straight to your next destination (Dixie Stampede for us). -It's quite a bit cheaper than Great Wolf Lodge (but still expensive). -The A/C unit had a remote control. Very nice. Bad: -The wireless internet did not work in our room. -The lady at the desk was snippy with me when I told her the rate she was going to charge was not what was quoted to us on the phone just a few hours earlier (we booked the same day we stayed the night) but fixed it. -They charge you quite a bit of money for breakfast that is the same quality as the free ones at other places. Take doughnuts. -They were short on lifeguards so they could only have one slide open at a time on Saturday. This not only cut out on play time, but also made the other areas very crowded with people who would have been sliding. This also caused a shortage of tubes required for the one slide. -They were also short on help in the restaurant and it took a very very long time to get our food, even when we were the ONLY people in there. -It is really loud when they are cleaning the water park in the mornings when your room is right above it. -There was only one umbrella at one table outside. There were several tables but no umbrellas. -The palm tree \"rain shower\" was not working outside. I think we will go back. Overall we had a good time, especially for booking last minute. It would have been nice for others in our family to be able to get a day pass but they were over booked that weekend so they weren't able to. There is a spa I'd like to have tried but we didn't have the time. I can't say much about service because we didn't really require any.

The toddler area is good with several slides and waterfalls to play in. Sorry grown-ups, no hot tub for you. My sister stayed in the family suite which is really just one big room with a mini-fridge, microwave and sink. It had the bunkbeds in a oversized closet with a tv. I got one the atruim rooms. Not realizing they are actually next door to the waterpark. They bought a \"Days Inn\" type motel. So nothing fancy, just a basic hotel room with exterior doors. To upgrade to the tower room was another $50/night. Not worth it to us. Luckily the weather was warm enough so this wasn't a problem walking across the parking lot.

We stayed there in the summer I was charged to sit out by the pool and I don't even swim or get in the water. The floor is more comfortable than the bunk beds. The restaurant is more like a grill and are over over price . The staff is not friendly. We were at the pool and they ran out of towels. Check in time on Sunday is 4 and the pool closes at 5. The hours for the water park need to be longer since that is why you go there in the first place. I brought 4 gift cards for family over the year I won't do that again. I would go to the other water park it also has hot tubs. We also has scheduled another trip and they canceled it because they had a problem with water when we were. My grandson was itching and had spots on him. They seem not to care.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":2,"Value":2,"Rooms":3,"Location":3,"Cleanliness":3},"date":"2014-12-03 04:54:07 +0300","author":"Adela Bogisich"},{"content":"We stayed one night and had the best time! We were greeted with kind employees at the front desk who informed us of all the amentites. Are room was excellent. it was clean and stocked with towels etc...We traveled with 2 children, 10 yr and 17 yr old. the water park was very relaxing...especially enjoyed the lazy river and water slide. Lots of towels to dry you off when your done swimming. Lots of seats to watch the kids. Quiet night atmosphere, unlike the loud strip noise if you stay on hwy 76. Nice, well stocked contenental breakfast in clean restaurant atmosphere. They even had a scavenger hunt plus other resort activities for more fun. Overall, I would stay again especially if you have small kids. We went minature golfing with gocarts which is right next door within walking distance. we never left the hotel except to eat dinner. buffet is right up the street also within walking distance.

The restaurant was not open and on the website the do not mention this, nor did they when I called to book the reservations. One slide was broken; but the water part was enjoyable to my 8 year old and 3 year old and the lifeguards were very nice. Now the manager of the resort Michael is a total different story! He is one of the rudest mangagers I think I have ever had to deal with. I checked into the hotel on Monday and checked out on Wed. I paid cash for my stay; but the hotel also charged my credit card not once but twice for my stay. A $323.60 stay ended up costing over $1200.00; when I contacted Michael to get the charges removed he was friendly at first and got 2 of the charges off. So after 48 hours 2 charges were still on my account; once again I contacted Michael; he told me once again he was working on this, after a few words he informed me if I was not nicer it would take a little longer than usual for the charges to get removed from my account, he was not concerned that I was calling the Better Business Bureau or my bank on the fraudulent charges. He also would not let me talk with his superior and hung up on me. Luckily the bank removed the chargers since I have my receipt showing I paid cash and I am contacting the Better Business Bureau. I would not recommend anyone to stay at this resort; newer is not always better.","ratings":{"Overall":1,"Service":1,"Value":1,"Rooms":1,"Location":1,"Cleanliness":1},"date":"2015-12-20 00:13:38 +0300","author":"Ignatius Gutkowski"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lon":-122.4432,"lat":37.7921},"free_breakfast":true,"email":"reservations@hoteldrisco.com","phone":"+1 415 346-2880","vacancy":false,"free_parking":false,"price":"$189-$259","address":"2901 Pacific Ave","description":"Built in 1903, this is a higher-end, boutique hotel right in the heart of Pacific Heights."}

Mixed Reviews - Explanation-We have been on over 40 all inclusive vacations. We have been to Punta Cana 6 times. We always book a 5 star and we know what we are talking about.-We went with our 11 year old daughter-This is a huge property with about 5 separate hotels/sections. Gran Bahia Punta Cana, Gran Bahia Bavaro, Ambar, Golden Principe, Diamond section, Premier and more. There are at least 5 lobbies. With this big a property and this many employees you will no doubt be disappointed with something and this hotel is not for those seeking a high quality, classy quaint place. - There are lots of employees and most employees are great but some do not care so if you meet the ones that don't care you will be disappointed. -There are many buffets but its a quantity objective with so many people to feed so do not expect high quality 5 star food or service but rather expect good cafeteria style all lined up. The food is fine, a bit repetitive, and you will have some good meals and some not so good.-The resort is noisy all night because the shuttle buses are very noisy and they run until 3 am and start again at 6 am and they run throughout the property. Even if your doors are closed you will hear them. You need the shuttles because even as athletic as we are the constant walking/running rather large distances is just exhausting. If you get a room near the main lobby you will hear the 9pm show and then the rerun late show at 10:30 pm.-The pools are nice and the beach is beautiful but these can be found at most of the hotels in Punta Cana.-The shows are for the most part pretty good for a resort like this.-There were not a lot of organized activities and some pretty basic if you were lucky to find them (bingo, mini put, mini golf is pretty good, darts, bike riding, pool activities almost non existent, beach activities few and far between) Don't come late because we were denied any bingo after the start.- Towels and towel cards. They ran out every day ! Get towels early or you may not get any. This is a huge resort with many guests and at peak times or rainy days they run out. Again, this is a mass market hotel.-They will fix problems with the rooms or switch your room. With a big property like this there are many many problems but they do get resolved. We heard of no hot water, requests for certain room types that the hotel claims they did not know about, no in room towels, etc. In all cases we also heard the hotel made good.-We highly recommend the premier section. It will give you the highest quality service and you will not pay extra. Do not pay extra for any section because it is not worth 2 pennies more. Its a bit of a marketing ploy. The Dalhia buffet in the Premier section is the best of the buffets. The specialty restaurants are for the most part not bad but quite frankly the Dalhia was better because the specialty restaurants still do not deliver 5 star at best 4 star.-So if you ask is there a better place in Punta Cana we say there is. The Riu Palaces (Macau or Punta Cana) are true 5 star service and quality and you pay maybe $500 more but its totally worth it if you want a 5 star experience.-Overall we could not stay at the Bahia Principe again because we know that for the money you can get more and we do not accept the short comings that we noted. But, there are lots of people who go to the Bahia Principe are very happy because they do not know better, really only want a 4 star experience, met some good employees who they bonded with or like really huge properties.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":2,"Value":2,"Rooms":3,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":3,"Business service":3,"Check in / front desk":3},"date":"2015-09-26 08:30:17 +0300","author":"Monte Rice"},{"content":"Amazing Wedding!

Let's get one thing out-of-the-way first. Yes, this is a timeshare. If you come here and accept discounts or other free products, you may be subjected to an annoying and potentially pressure packed timeshare presentation. If that's not for you, then don't accept the perk. But I have little empathy for people that accept the perk and then complain about the presentation after-the-fact. The location of this condo is pretty good. While it is located just one block off the strip, blocks in Vegas are huge. It is behind Imperial Palace but will take approximately 15 minutes to walk to the strip. Because of the bend in the strip near this location if you are attending a conference at the Sands convention Center then this is a really nice location. You can walk to the Sands convention Center in a little over 10 minutes. The grounds are very nice and maintained well. You walk around on the interior of the complex which consists of multiple buildings that are three stories in height. The grass and shrubs are well-maintained and we found the paths to be well lit. There are nicely done pools as well as areas to grill. Our unit had an exterior patio with tables and chairs as well. Parking seemed abundant though it did appear that the resort was lightly I can pied when we were here. Every parking space is covered with an overhead sun shield structure which was a nice touch to keep the hot desert sun off the interior of your cars during the summer months. The complex is surrounded by fencing with only one way in and out and that path has 24-hour guard service. There is free Wi-Fi on the complex and we found the signal inside our unit to be very strong and very fast. We did not use a lot of the resort amenities or any of the activities so we can't comment on those. Now onto the unit itself. We found the unit to be well-equipped, in good working condition, and very nicely furnished. You walk immediately into a small living room that has a sofa and a single chair. There is a large flatscreen TV on the wall above a gas fireplace. In the same area, there is a small four-person kitchen table with a few extra chairs as well as two barstools at an L-shaped kitchen bar that also serves as part of the kitchen countertops. There are two bedrooms, both of which also have large flatscreen TVs mounted to the wall as well as large walk-in closets for both. This was a nice feature to keep all of your luggage completely out-of-the-way and to hang up all of your clothes. Our only disappointment was that the second bedroom had a single queen size bed in it instead of two separate twin beds as is common at many timeshares. This means that a family with two kids will either have to try to get the two kids to sleep in the same bed or put one on the sleeper sofa in the living room. The master bathroom is not separated from the master bedroom it is part of the same large room except for the toilet which is in a separate small space behind door. The master bath tub is massive. It is literally approximately 7' x 4' in size and you step into the tub to take a shower from the single showerhead. If you and your partner in the master bedroom happen to have different schedules then the lights from the bathroom sink will shine directly on the bed where the other partner is attempting to sleep. The bathtub is completely impractical after you get over your initial wow moment of seeing the size of it. The problem is that the water heater is not even close to being adequately sized to fill the tub. After a long day on the strip we thought it would be great to relax in the tub. After sitting in it and turning on the hot water we could get water only to the height of about halfway up our leg before we ran out of hot water. This is a completely ridiculous design. The second bath has a shower only, no tub. All things considered, we enjoyed out stay here and would return.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-12-07 01:07:48 +0300","author":"Olin Waelchi"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lon":-122.436,"lat":37.7969},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1 415 346-0424","vacancy":true,"free_parking":true,"price":"$190-$330","address":"2299 Union St","description":"Edwardian home with spacious airy rooms and a quaint cottage garden in the back."}

We were traveling with my Brother-in-law and his wife, and they insisted on a king, and we thought a condo with kitchen might serve us well. There were others that found what we did- but all the propaganda claimed this resort had been totally renovated, so I chose to believe \"shabby\" and \"outdated\" were behind this place. We checked in just after midnight. I hoped upon hope that we would have a remodeled condo. Not so lucky. As others have mentioned... NO ELEVATOR. We were placed in #7 (there are MANY buildings) on the third floor. All the buildings look alike. I hoped that meant \"remodeled\". NOT. The furniture was green vinyl with huge rips in the upholstery. The cabinetry was 1970ish laminate with rose colored, tired Formica countertops. The carpet was dirty in appearance and shabby. The mattresses hadn't been replaced in a LONG while. For 4 nights, I slept at a 22 degree slant, rolling to the middle of the bed. One of the towels I used had (what appeared to be) dirty footprints. The gas pilot light in the fireplace was on all the time and REALLY noisy. The Contact paper in the cupboards was all peeling. I could go on. You get the picture. Sure, the location is nice. Couple blocks off the strip, easy to park, no death march to the ends of mile long hotel corridors. But again, luck of the draw. Our condo faced the parking lot. We had a great view of the rental car from our balcony, The bedroom window didn't stay open for long... folks arguing in the parking lot woke us up. Busses dropping off inebriated guests after dark made it real difficult to sleep. I felt mislead by webpages stating this place had been fully remodeled. Had I known there was a risk of getting the shabby room we got, I would have spent a few more bucks and gone somewhere else.

I chose it because the reviews were much less scary than the hotels on the strip in our price range. After booking I continued to read more reviews and started to get a little worried, but all of those worries were for nothing. Here's the play by play: We flew in at 7:30am and Check-In time wasn't until 4pm, but we decided to try our luck. After picking up our rental car we arrived at Summer Bay about 8:30am. We had no trouble finding the entrance, or temporary front desk, and barely noticed the construction at the front of the complex. At the front desk, they told us they had a room ready for us, no problem. I tried to hint around, hoping to get an upgrade to an owner suite, mentioned our anniversary, then flat out asked if they were booked up. She said they were full. Oh well, can't blame a gal for trying! We got to our room (Building 3, 207) and loved it from the moment we walked in. Spacious living room and kitchen, nice big king size bed, and huge garden tub. Everything was clean, and, despite a little bit of wear on the couch, very welcoming. This was a One Bedroom rental, so there was just a small two person table in the kitchen, and 'old-style (read:non-flat-screen) TVs. Worked for us, who goes to Vegas to watch TV?!? However, all the remotes were missing batteries, one call to the front desk and that was fixed. I've read complaints on these reviews about not enough towels, and not enough, and too small pillows. There were plenty of each, with extras under the sink and in the closet. Check out my pictures to see the room, and the great view from the balcony. We did visit the concierge, and she was helpful, though we didn't end up going to any shows. We also used the free shuttle, which was great! They pick up at the back of the property, so it was a little walk from where we were, but I think a golf cart went by and offered a ride everytime. The shuttle always picked up and dropped off right on time. And remember it's FREE, so even though we had a rental car, we used the shuttle so we didn't have to worry about parking. The times were very convenient, and the drivers all very pleasant. The grounds are beautiful. We walked around once, and probably didn't see half of it. The pool closest to us was under construction, and we didn't have much time so we didn't swim. The only very, very minor complaint I have is, we didn't get maid service (our choice) so I asked for an extra packet of coffee for our second morning, and they wouldn't give it to me. Like I said, very minor! The free popcorn at the front desk totally made up for it! In conclusion, I don't think we'd stay anywhere else if/when we return, and I've already recommended Summer Bay whenever I hear anyone mention going to Vegas!","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":4,"Value":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2014-04-05 17:09:16 +0300","author":"Coralie Turner"},{"content":"This place was great, tons of space, 2 bedrooms, full kitchen, laundry! perfect place for a family trip or to stay with a few couples, you can save $ on food by making your own meals in their fully stocked kitchen, you can pack less (save on those pesky luggage airline fees!) because you can wash your clothes, they even provide detergent and it's all conveniently in your suite. these suites were perfect, HUGE awesome bathtub in the master 2. choice of I think 4 pools and on site entertainment as well. just a short walk or shuttle ride to the strip, 2 blocks away and the price was amazing for a vegas hotel on a weekend!!!

Which was cut down to 1 day because it was such an awful hotel. I wondered how the maid and grounds keeper knew how long we were staying anyway! If you go to this hotel, DO NOT reserve a regular room! I didn't realize the difference between a regular room and the junior suite. There is a HUGE difference, the regular room is so small that my husband hurt his back because he had to twist through the front door to get our suitcases in the room. Here was NO ROOM for our 4 SMALL pieces of luggage. We were in room 203 on the second floor. A large sized person might not make it though the door into the room! They had two beds, which looked smaller than full's, crammed into a very small space. The mattresses were set into a square pressed board, make shift frame. Which ALL of us kept hitting our toes and knees on, we ended up having to put our luggage around the corners to keep from hitting our legs, but we still kept hitting our toes. You had to squeeze past the bed to get out on the patio, the screen door may as well have not even been there, it was broken and very hard to open and close. There were only 3 towels and 1 washcloth, I had to go down to get my own towels. If you ask for towels to the pool, you have to sign a card and personally return them to the office!

The shuttle service is incredible. Golf carts to take you from the room to the front, small busses to take you to various points on the strip every hour, freemont street at night, and even a grocery store in the morning. The rooms were clean, modern, and very comfortable. The pool areas are excellent as well, with lots of lounge chairs, clean washrooms, great spa, heated pool, open 24hrs., music until 10pm, bbqs, picnic cabbanas, and no problem enjoying beverages (in non breakable containers of course). The Wi-Fi internet was difficult to get connected to, but we were informed on the info sheet that it still was being created, so it was not a surprise we had troubles. The resort is located two streets behind Imperial Palace, so about 10 min walk to the strip. You have to cross vacant land (still on a sidewalk and street), and the vacant land is a little messy, and can be a little intimidating, but no problems with it.

In a nutshell, only a great deal on pricing would bring us back—at least until the place is finished. Pros. Staff was uniformly friendly and helpful when possible. (Maintenance came to fix our microwave 10 minutes after calling—even though it was about 1 AM!). Our two BR unit was nicely furnished and looked recently renovated. I’d rate it a 9 out of 10. Grounds nicely manacured and floral. An hourly shuttle service takes you to various locations on the strip or you can simply walk to the nearest Hotel (Harrah's) in about 12 minutes. Golf carts will shoosh you around the resort if you call, but it was small enough to walk in. It was certainly quiet if that's what you came to LV for. Cons. No curb appeal at all. The front area is a construction eyesore of half chewed demolished buildings and dusty pavement (but oddly, there was not much actual construction activity while we were there). The ‘resort’ is actually a recently converted residential condo cluster of some 600 units. We’re told that the resort had been across the street but was bought and demolished by a nearby big hotel and SB took over and renovated these residential condos. Thus, sitting between this new resort and the strip is one LONG block of desolate no-man’s-land: fenced in dust and debris, some employee parking, scrub weeds. Big plans for development we’re told, but no construction as of yet. (The economy?) We walked to the strip day and night (Harrah’s) numerous times, feeling no unease, but when it’s 107 degrees and an ugly nothing, you might want to wait for the shuttle--if it's going where you want at that time--plan well. There is no gym, no club house, no spa, no consistently functioning internet, and no welcome activities. They do their best to back fill (in-room spa treatments, for example), but it’s simply an apartment you’re getting--not a resort. Lacking a finished office area, all the check-in and other resort services are handled in converted guest rooms—cramped and un-inviting. The shuttle goes to different spots at different times and is often too small for the number of passengers. There is only one shuttle per day to Von’s supermarket. The three pleasant pools/hot tubs are nestled among groups of condo buildings but are small and un-interesting (but were uncrowded). Remember, these were apartment pools, not luxurious hotel or resort pools. (But their proximity and fences would be ideal for families with young children.) The construction sign says “Gold Crown Rating” (an RCI standard of excellence) but it is not. A Summer Bay internal “Crown Club” is in the making, which will allow SB owners to get into the other 9 or so SB properties (Missouri, Tennessee, Florida…) Bottom line: If you can snag a 2-BR $249 RCI last-minute RCI special here it’s a comfortable, if a bit out of the way, place to nest for the Las Vegas strip experience. Shuttles (common everywhere in LV) make up somewhat for the heat and distance. If you’re spending many hundreds, however, look at discount packages at strip hotels. The older properties start at $39/nite. You’ll only get a cheap room, but you’ll be in the thick of the action. In 2010 there should be some relief from the dust and lack of facilities.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":4,"Value":3,"Rooms":5,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":4},"date":"2012-10-14 03:21:45 +0300","author":"Kamille Leannon"},{"content":"We stayed at this location June 12-19, 2009 and had a great time.

We walked to Ellis Island casino for breakfast and to Tuscany casino (both off strip) for good deals. It was a dirty sight to walk to the strip with the beer bottles and litter but we could have taken the free shuttle from the resort to various locations on the strip to avoid this view.

A word of advice to those of you who complain about problems after you have checked out - if you have an issue with something, get them to fix it or ask to be moved. They will gladly accommodate your requests.

We stayed at Summer Bay in June and plan to return this summer as well. We had our two children (ages 4 and 1) and felt very safe in the area and resort. Plenty of parking was right outside our door and we felt safe enough to leave the GPS in the car. It was great to be close enough to run outside and start the car to get the a/c running ahead of time- June can be very hot! We must have had an updated unit (in the Suites section) as our furniture, carpet, king sized bed, granite vanity, and appliances were new. The leather sofa sleeper had a memory foam mattress and was very comfortable. We usually have to put sofa mattresses on the floor. There were two tv's in our 1BR unit and the kitchen was well stocked, not that I'd ever want to cook in Vegas. The resort is one block off the strip so we walked to the buffets with the kids and then drove to Hoover Dam and other attractions. I liked to get my complimentary coffee and go for a morning walk before the crowds and heat hit the strip. They offer a poolside luau, but we already had plans that night. The concierge \"Scary Cary\" was fantastic with many coupons and discounts. They even printed our boarding passes before we left. I'm not saying that the other reviews are untruthful (except the one that said it's far off the strip) only that every experience is different. I also think the section within the resort must make a difference. We enjoyed the \"Suites\" but I heard that the \"Towers\" (main building) is best for proximity to pools, concierge, gym, monorail, etc. Just my 2 cents, for what it's worth.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":3,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2015-01-11 23:12:04 +0300","author":"Lilian Ward"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lon":-122.4164,"lat":37.7884},"free_breakfast":true,"email":"mithilahotel@aol.com","phone":"+1 415 441-9297","vacancy":false,"free_parking":true,"price":"Average Price $115","address":"972 Sutter Street","description":"Established in 1920, this is a relatively clean hotel and reasonably priced."}

The great thing about staying in the main building is that if you don't have a car, which we didn't, then it is the nearest building to the strip. It only took 5 mins (if that) to get to the back of Harrah's casino. You have to walk through a car park to get there and i was a bit concerned on our first walk that it was a bit dodgy and especially at night, but i couldn't have been more wrong.

None of these requests were honored when I got there. I was told by the person at the desk just because I made that requests did not mean that these facilites were available. We were given rooms on the second floor, on opposite sides of the building, and the rollaways never materialized the entire week. My husband and I were interested in information about the RCI Points System, so we attended their timeshare presentation. The reward were tickets to a magic show at the Greek Isles. The tickets and show were not worth the time. The Greek Isles is a very run down place. If you attend the presentation, I would take their option for a show at the Sahara instead. The sales presentation was not high pressure, however. Two things that we did during the week that were really oustanding were going to the show, KA at the MGM. It is pricey, but worth it.

This hotel is located right off of I-95 and in a well populated area with hospitals, shopping centers, stores and restaurants. It is one of the first hotels in the development, very easy to find, right next to a gas station, a McDonald's and a Taco Bell. The parking lot always had plenty of spaces, check-in was a breeze, all staff we encountered were very nice and accomodating. The lobby was beautiful, with plenty of seating and as is customary in Marriott brand hotels, hot tea and coffee 24/7. The room was very bright and comfortable. My only gripe was the channel selection on the TV was limited and there was a fuzzy reception on some cable channels. There was no fan in the bathroom but the mirror cleared up pretty quickly once the bathroom door was open. My only complaint (and it's not really a complaint) is that the location of the hotel is still far out from the harbor. Every restaurant or business we went to in that area was at least 20 minutes away each way by car. But the hotel was great, quiet, excellent for our needs and our standards.

However, it may not be for everyone for several reasons. First of all, we rented the \"Ko'olani Kai\", which is directly on the water. When I say directly, I mean we were looking at the ocean from about 20 ft away from both windows in the master BR, as well as both windows in the livingroom! It was just beautiful in this regard and exactly what i had hoped for. There was little (if anything) else on the north shore for the same price that was right on the water. The unit was plenty spacious for my husband and me, traveling with my (adult) son. This 2 BR unit had 1 bathroom, so consider whether this is a comfortable arrangement for your party...it was fine for us. It is, however, a little basic...maybe \"rustic\" in some ways. If you normally stay at the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton, you are unlikely to be happy here. The linens and pillows were not what I would consider hotel quality. There was no bath soap or shampoo provided, and many of the windows were not in working condition. Too bad, because we would not have needed the A/C, if we had been able to open the place up and get some of that beautiful ocean breeze! The kitchen was up-to-date, with decent appliances...we did a fair amount of cooking in as there are few restaurants close by. The kitchen is a little \"funny\" though...some of the cabinets are blocked by the new fridge, which is apparently bigger than the original! And, yes, we did see (just one) cockroach, but I killed him! And yes, there were tiny ants that were attracted to the counters if food was left out...easy enough--we simply did not leave anything on the counters. So, overall, we were quite happy here, despite a little tackiness, and these few issues above. Would I recommend it to people? Well, it depends on who you are and what your priorities are. Also to consider...some units are closer to the road, ours was not which we liked.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":4,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":3},"date":"2015-05-07 13:34:33 +0300","author":"Miss Ramona Doyle"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lon":-122.4091,"lat":37.7899},"free_breakfast":false,"email":null,"phone":"+1 415 421-3154","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":"$80–$180","address":"715 Bush Street","description":"A small and historic hotel with a French theme."}

We had a fantastic time and I would recommend this place to a friend. Service: Zack was professional, organized, friendly and prompt from my original booking on through the follow-up after we returned home. It is a self-service rental, but they were quick with supplying snorkle gear, kayak paddles and sand toys for my daughter. The grounds are well maintained--the trimmed lawn, plentiful foliage, and comfortable hot-tub. We didn't mind paying for laundry, I guess because we knew that was part of the deal. Ammenities: Our group was mixed on the lack of AC. My mother-in-law (coming from the Texas heat) loved the fresh air and sound of the ocean with the windows and patio open (which we had to watch like hawks as we have a curious two year old). I (coming from chilly San Francisco) wished I could have escaped the humidity just for a bit. Mostly the lack of AC creates a problem for the owner's--wear and tear on the building exterior due to sea salt, new ceiling fans already inoperable, etc. The kitchen was nicely updated with plently of utensils, some nice peices of furniture. The couches were dated, worn and covered with slip covers that loved to collect sand. Not really a problem for us, but not exactly luxurious if that is what you are looking for. The top floor was empty while we were there, so that wasn't really a problem. Parking was no problem either. You do have to be careful backing out, but it wasn't that big of a deal. The biggest problem for my husband was the WiFi never worked (I actually liked being disconnected from the rest of the world!) Location: Excellent! A nice big lanai, lawn with picnic table and chairs, retaining wall and a short drop to the beach! No, it is not a wading beach, but that didn't really bother us since our children are still a bit young--we loved just playing in the sand. My husband and I did snorkle right off the back--it can be done! The visibility was not great, but we did see sea turtles which was neat. My father in law took the kayak out and enjoyed that. Near-by: We loved hiking the Hauula Loop, there is a grocery store just up the street. We never went, but the Polynesian Cultural center is just five minutes. We enjoyed some nice dinners out at Turtle Bay Resort, Waimea Joe's at Haiku Gardens and The Crouching Lion Inn--all not that far of a drive away. We found a playground about 15 minutes south with a great snowcone/breakfast/lunch place across the street. We enjoyed day trips to the Northshore where there is a great spot to watch the sea turtle bask in the sun, a beautiful protected reef for snorkling and a shopping/dining district. We also enjoyed Kualoa Park and hiking up to Diamond Head. We never went into Waikiki or Honolulu. Oahu is a small island and it is possible to do quite a lot in a week (or not a lot if that is what you prefer). We were perfectly happy to be in the small village of Hauula--it was just what we wanted. Value: We feel this is a great value. It is not high-end, but laid-back and perfect for families--especially if you have a large group you could rent out several of the properties! It was a hassle free experience (and that means a lot considering we were traveling with two small children!). It is a gorgeous setting--exactly what we had in mind when we booked it.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":4},"date":"2014-08-24 19:59:45 +0300","author":"Ramona Metz Jr."},{"content":"First things first: Keep in mind that this is a hostal and not a five-star-hotel. If you want a big breakfast, conference rooms and a pool, this is not for you. If you want a comfortable room in a very central location to relax from your excursions through lively Madrid, it is 100% perfect. LOCATION Could it be any more central? I don’t think so! You are right on Gran Vía, with a 10 minutes’ walk to Puerta del Sol and all kinds of shops and amenities near by. I actually felt like I fell out of my cozy room right into the middle of things – in a good way! Madrid is a very compact city, but it’s still nice to be in the center’s center ;-) THE WAY FROM THE AIRPORT No need for a taxi, just take the metro for Euro 2,50 and you’ll be there in about 30 minutes. Personally, I would take the option that makes you change just once and get out at Plaza España (the hotel website offers three possible connections). The Santo Domingo stop may be right in front of the hotel and Plaza España a short walk up Gran Vía, but I found the latter more comfortable because for Santo Domingo, you have to change lines twice – more complicated and takes a little longer. THE HOSTAL You will find it on the 8th floor of a nice old building. There are two elevators, one to be used for your luggage (it’s fairly small) and one used by hotel guests and people living in the appartments on the other seven floors. The hostal has a reception area (you pay when checking in) and a big and airy common room with a TV. Everything is set in white and dark grey, so it looks more like a design hotel than a hostal. I also happened to see the bathroom for the rooms without a bath; it looked new and shiny, all black and white. The staff was very nice and welcoming - I liked the fact that there was always somebody at the reception desk when I returned at night, made me feel extra safe. THE ROOM I had a single room (nr. 16) and was positively surprised by its layout (about 9m²) and cleanliness. It had one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in! The bathroom is small (about 2m²) but totally adequate, the water pressure and temperature in the shower was very good all day. There was a small table and chair, a build-in wardrobe, AC, a TV and free (and fast!) W-LAN (get the code at the reception). My room did not have a view, which I did not mind, because it meant there was no noise from Gran Vía to be heard. As is the case with many Spanish flats and their rather thin walls, you might hear some noise from other rooms though, so if you are a light sleeper, make sure to bring some ear plugs. OVERALL VERDICT I am sure I will stay at Hostal Besaya again, because it offers excellent budget accomodation. Madrid is an amazing place for going out and shopping, so I prefer to spend more on retail therapy than on accomodation :-) Hostal Besaya offers great value for money - see you again in 2012!","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2012-12-18 02:49:53 +0300","author":"Zelda Towne"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lon":-122.4099,"lat":37.7898},"free_breakfast":false,"email":"info@goldengatehotel.com","phone":"+1 415 392-3702","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":"$95–$150","address":"775 Bush Street","description":"A charming budget hotel in an old Victorian."}

We shopped at the local grocery store (make sure to sign up for a savings card - which is free - to save even more money) which also had a $1/night DVD rental we used one night when we just felt like relaxing inside.

As some tips, street parking is free so you don't need to pay for hotel parking if you are on a budget. There is a lot (about 1.5 blocks to the west of the hotel) that is $5 a day and one right beside that at $12 a day. You can buy snacks/drinks cheaply at the ABC Store all around Front street if you want to stock up.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2015-11-30 16:04:18 +0300","author":"Brady Effertz"},{"content":"Location perfect Service perfect room size perfect clean perfect staff perfect Parking access is dedicated only if you have high driving skills Rooms size is exactly opposite of parking size..happilly im not a car","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2015-02-27 05:05:42 +0300","author":"Lavinia Schulist DVM"},{"content":"The best part of Paris that we have found so far.

The first morning we were there we went down to the lobby (if you can even call it that!) to get coffee and over heard the woman at the desk saying something about our room and how pissed we were, we were totally confused. When the lady had called the night before we were very apologetic and told her we didn't realize we were even being loud. We decided not to confront the staff while overhearing them talk about our room because we were already hip to their rude character!!! Furthermore, the cable TV was a joke, you couldn't watch anything as their satelite was all screwed up! The maid service was terrible! The coffee machine was broken for the last two mornings we were there. We would go into the lobby and say good morning and the woman they had in there in the mornings just glared at you and didn't even greet you!!!

We needed someplace clean, close to the beach and a good value. We weren't disappointed. Although, I don't ideally want to have a direct view of the pool, which all the nearby hotels had, the ocean was a few feet behind it and we were fully able to enjoy it from the balcony--which is an enclosed, shared space for the entire floor. For what we spent per night we felt that we hit the lottery with this hotel. Our room was clean and the bathroom was recently updated and for the little amount of time we actually spent in the room vs. our time on the beach, it was a great find.

Magnificent swells curling through the Crystal Pier to the North. Early morning walks on the beautiful beach. Breakfast at \"Konos\" (outstanding value + fun spot). No stuffy \"upscale\" hotel atmospherics. Jus' friendly folks. I can understand why the rates more than double in the Summer.

Although the apartments arent advertised as a sea view, we had a pretty decent view of the beach from our balcony, beach itself was beautiful and literally about 30 seconds walk away! Bathroom was fine, very clean and towels were changed every day, shower was great really powerful and hot! The beach cottages also provide free Wireless broadband which worked great. My only complaint about the place was the lack of air conditioning, we stayed in september which is one of the warmest months of the year and the room was very warm if you didnt have the doors wide open(which obviously you cant do at night!). In terms of nightlife this place is great, loads of bars/restaurants just minutes walk away and if you want to take a trip to downtown its only 10 mins or so in a cab.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":4,"Value":4,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3,"Check in / front desk":3},"date":"2015-01-13 13:14:58 +0300","author":"Kayla Lindgren"},{"content":"Stayed at the Beach Cottages for 4 nights on our honeymoon.

We almost booked a hotel in the heart of Old Montreal, and we're really glad we didn't! We took a stroll through Old Montreal on Sunday afternoon, and it felt really dead - many of the shops and restaurants were actually closed. I was really surprised, because I had been there in the summer before and it was incredibly vibrant and bustling. It has an outdoor skating rink, so I thought Old Montreal would be just as busy as the summer. Or that shops would be open at the very least! Back to the hotel - the pool with the glass bottom was fun, but it was jam-packed with kids every time we went. The pool had an attendant, which was nice, but the attendants never asked the kids (or parents) to refrain from doing cannonballs into the pool, which got to be rather annoying for those getting splashed in the adjacent hot tub! I know that makes me sound old and curmudgeonly, but running around a pool doing haphazard cannonballs seems potentially dangerous, not just disruptive. The gym was great - clean and well-equipped. The room service was prompt and excellent. The morning breakfast buffet at The Gazette, on the other hand, was over-crowded and over-priced. We had to wait about 15 minutes to get a seat at the bar (not even a table!) and apparently we were lucky - the line to get in snaked all the way out the door when we left. At $22 a person, we would have been better off ordering off the menu. The buffet was ok, but I think $12 would have been a more reasonable price considering the selection. Loved the free wi-fi and in-room coffee. One minor housekeeping gripe: I opened the sealed shower cap and found it had already been used, and was full of soap! That was gross. Overall, though, I'd stay there again. It was comfortable and friendly.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":4,"Value":3,"Rooms":3,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":3,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2013-05-27 23:59:19 +0300","author":"Gennaro Blick"},{"content":"Le Westin is in a great location in Old Montreal.

Unless I were returning to Montreal for a convention/meeting at this hotel or across the street, I would not likely return to this property. For the price I eventually paid after upgrades, I would also have been much happier at one of the boutique properties nearby in Vieux Montreal. I am a SPG Gold member, so I am entitled to a room upgrade upon availability. Hoping to get a Club Floor room, I upgraded to a premium room at reservation time for an extra $30/night. At check-in, I was told I could not be further upgraded--Club upgrades were limited to SPG Platinum members. So, my three night stay I paid for an upgrade to a better room which I would have received at no cost otherwise. I asked about the cost to upgrade to Club Floor, and forked over an extra $60/night to do so. So, from an original CAA/AAA rate of $175/night, I paid $265/night for a room and service in a hotel which was lackluster. As a previous reviewer described, the premium room was unappealing. It was a 1-bedroom suite, but the living room had no windows and therefore we never utilized that room. The bedroom was average size in my opinion--probably smaller than the standard size bedrooms elsewhere in the hotel because of the space taken away to create the separate enclosed living room. Bathroom was nice enough, but lacked a bathtub in which I would have enjoyed soaking during this stay. Hotel was very quiet and empty during the three-night stay (Sun-Wed). As a busy conference hotel, it might be fine, but even when empty we felt the hotel was impersonal and we were anonymous as guests (even though our faces were familiar to some of the staff day after day). Location was convenient to Vieux Montreal and to downtown areas--probably the best merit of the property. Club floor privileges were a complete waste of money and rather pathetic. The Club Lounge is essentially defunct. Except for cold beverages available in the refrigerators in the Lounge, there was no other food/beverage service available in the lounge. For breakfast, everyone is sent to the restaurant on the ground floor. Buffet breakfast there was merely adequate. We ate each morning around 9:30 a.m. and consistently found the hot foods barely warm if even warm. Food quality and variety wasn't anything exceptional either, with the noted exception of very good croissants. I certainly wouldn't want to pay $21+ for the buffet otherwise. From 5-7 p.m., you can return to the ground floor restaurant/bar for either tapas or a glass of wine/beer (take your pick) with the SPG coupon provided. The crab cakes we ordered one night were awful. The calamari was fine, as was the coconut shrimp. The only thing that lived up to Starwood expectation, in my opinion, was the typical Starwood quality bed/mattress which provided a comfortable night sleep--that is once we removed all feather products from the bedroom! Otherwise, this was a completely forgettable, albeit expensive, hotel experience.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":3,"Value":2,"Rooms":3,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":3,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2015-09-13 23:31:55 +0300","author":"Sigurd Crona"},{"content":"We enjoyed our stay at the Westin.

The Check-in at 1am was very slow - and despite the time, there were a bunch of us waiting to check in.

Location is great right near Old Montreal and walking distance to downtown. Refrigerator in the room - helpful to keep some drinks in the room. Negatives: dirty/used coffee filter in the coffeemaker filter area covered with condensation - we called the desk and they came to clean the filter but we were repulsed by it and never bothered using it the entire time we stayed. Who knows how long it was in there for? If it weren't for this, I would rate the hotel experience as excellent. Pool was smaller than expected - high children traffic. The jacuzzi- area wasn't much of one - just a warm tub - no water jets. Slow and inefficient valet parking system (they don't take down the model or the car license plate so when you want to pick up the car, the guy ends up looking for it for 15 min and coming back to ask for the car model and color afterall). tip: There are less expensive indoor parking nearby - so you don't HAVE to keep the car at the hotel valet parking (approx $26/night).

The bathroom was really nice with granite counter tops and the shower was a nice size. Everything else was typical Westin quality. The best part is that high speed internet was included in the room rate. This is not the case for most Westins I've stayed at. The only complaint I had was that housekeeping came really late, sometimes after 4:00pm. We sometimes came back to nap during that time, so that got somewhat tricky. Also, housekeeping didn't replace the shampoo or bar soaps. I know they are trying to cut down on waste, but if we have empty shampoo bottles in the shower, they should be replaced.

When we saw the brand new Westin was open, we figured it would be the perfect place as Westins are usually cool and the hotel was in a great location. Anyway, we arrived in Montreal and pulled up to a very ugly driveway and were greeted with a very visible front and center overflowing trash can by the valet station. That was a terrible first impression. The lobby was stark, barren and plain and they were three hours late getting us our room -- sitting around a lobby is no way to start a vacation. The rooms and hallways were corporate and plain, really surprising for a new hotel. And the towels were so brand new that there were fuzzies over all our clothes and in our hair every day. Ultimately, if you need a clean place to stay with very comfortable beds, the Westin is great. If you want a hotel you'll remember, forget it. It feels like no thought or style was put into this hotel. Just blah and generic, like out of a movie that satirizes corporate generic hotels.

One towel per person, a bed, shower, toilet and television, even a window in the room costs more. We stayed here for 4 nights, solely for the location's convenience; being a 5 minute walk from Hyde Park, around the corner from Paddington Station and with supermarkets, cafes and other stores all located nearby. After reading the reviews on TripAdvisor prior to our stay, we paid the extra amount per night for the 'Room with Window' and were exceptionally glad that we did. The rooms are very small and without that extra light it would only seem smaller. We were on the 3rd floor, and there was still quite a lot of noise coming from the street and through the walls - low voices, people packing in the mornings, buses outside - so definitely ask for a higher room if it is available. That said, there are no elevators in this building, so it will mean carrying your luggage up several flights of stairs. This hotel was fine for our short stay (4 nights, but any longer would have been too long), and is probably not a problem if you're relatively tidy, and prepared for budget & basic.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":2,"Value":4,"Rooms":3,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":3},"date":"2015-08-12 06:54:02 +0300","author":"Kendra Padberg"},{"content":"I've never stayed in an Easyhotel and I won't be again.

Is ideally positioned 5 minutes walk from Paddington Station so is great for either linking with the Heathrow Express or using the Underground to get around town. Plenty of food choices around, nothing fancy but youâ€™ll get a satisfying feed (The Exchange near the local Laundromat is a kid friendly pub with good hospitality, and the food is tasty and cheap) Sainsburys and M&S have express stores at the train station so you can get the basics at reasonable prices Check in process went without a hitch, and they even let us check in early without charging us extra. Reception is manned 24 hours and everyone we dealt with on there was friendly and tried to be helpful, including booking us hire car for our early departure. Now to the room. I knew it was going to be small, website has dimensions etc but was still taken aback at the lack of usable floor space for bags and moving around. Effectively good sized double bed surrounded by the walls on three sides with a little built in bedside table. My carry -on luggage took all the little bit of floor by the bedside table. That leaves the area between the door, bathroom and bed. About 6 feet long by two and bit feet wide my big case used most of that. I expected a small room, had read the reviews and basically itâ€™s exactly what I thought itâ€™d be. If you donâ€™t mind stepping over your luggage you wonâ€™t find it a problem. Bathroom tiny like onboard a ship, but very clean and functional. Must say bed was really comfortable too. Room has small LCD TV (you pay to get the remote which is worthwhile) and we had an air con unit so could control temp really well.

Cleanliness & Service: Let me start with the worst part: Bed Bugs (which I fortunately spotted in the first night). This is not necessarily a question of how the rooms are cleaned, but the staff at the reception seemed rather unconcerned. I was not offered another room but had to insist on it, and to actually get the room, I had to return early to make sure that not all other rooms were taken. At least the management seems to have taken care of the problem and my second room (on the same floor) was ok. Other than that, both rooms and their bathrooms were reasonably clean, but you have to be aware that rooms are only cleaned when guests change or for an additional fee. Rooms: The rooms themselves provide the absolute minimum you need. It's sufficient for a weekend in the city but not suited for a longer stay. Like their web page says: there are \"2 clothes hanging hooks provided\", and there is hardly any room for luggage. There is no shelf or hook in the bathroom to put any toiletries. For the rooms with a window to the street, there's another downside. The hotel is in a sidestreet and there's not much traffic, but there's a noisy bus stop right in front of the hotel. Besides that, the sound insulation between the rooms is also rather bad. Location: The location is pretty good, with Paddington station and the underground around the corner and lots of pubs and affordable restaurants in the area.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":2,"Value":2,"Rooms":2,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":2},"date":"2014-03-14 01:43:56 +0300","author":"Pearl Watsica"},{"content":"I'm quite familiar with budget hotels, and my expectations are usually quite low for them... but easyHotel still left me a little shocked. Overall, not a bad stay, but there was definitely more nickel-and-diming than I'd seen anywhere in ages. I booked a small room \"with window,\" and since I was arriving around 10 a.m. on Christmas Day, I inquired about checking in earlier than the usual check-in time, by e-mailing the hotel. I was told that I'd have to book the previous night (Christmas Eve) in order to check in that early. First, that turned out to be untrue (the hotel offered early check-in for only 10 GBP). Second, even though I did pay 24 GBP to book that room for the Christmas Eve, once I turned up at the hotel, the front-desk clerk tried to tell me that since I'd arrived after 10 a.m. (check-OUT time for the night before), my reservation was worthless. Sound confusing? Quite. I pulled out the printed version of the e-mail telling me exactly the opposite, and started to explain, and he immediately did an about-face and said that, fine, I could indeed check in. I was given a room on the \"lower ground floor,\" which was, of course, a basement. I made my way down the stairs and opened the door. I wasn't put off by the tiny space, but I was quite appalled (as the last reviewer was) that the room \"with window\" actually had a window that had a lovely view of the hallway. As the room was uncomfortably warm, and the a/c didn't seem to work, I went back upstairs and asked if perhaps they had any rooms with windows to the outside world. I was told that for 10 GBP a night, I could \"upgrade\" to a bigger room with a real window. I knew I wouldn't sleep in the heat, so I splurged and got a room on the third floor. It was fine. Again, the a/c didn't cool the room, but the window wide open (there were no pesky restrictions on that, thankfully) cooled things down nicely. In early mornings, it was far too loud to sleep with the window open, however. Speaking of loud, the walls were thick enough to not hear into my neighbors' room, but the doors were incredibly thin and let in even the softest noise, day and night, from the hallway. When doors slammed (as they did quite often), the sound boomed through the room. The bathroom boasted a terrible smell for my entire stay, despite it appearing very clean. Think there must be some sewer problems. The tiny sink didn't drain very quickly, and that it stuck out all of eight inches from the wall, it was virtually impossible to wash your face (given the lack of a washcloth) without getting water all over the floor. The room was indeed small, but I was only one person and only had one piece of luggage. What was more than a little aggravating was that there was not a SINGLE flat surface anywhere in the room. Not a shelf on the wall, side table, nothing. So I was always stepping over piles of things on the floor trying to get ready in the morning. I actually used the outside windowsill to store spare change, etc. The room was clean but not spotless. There were some stray hairs on the comforter that led me to believe it doesn't get washed between every stay, more like shaken out... Oddly, someone \"cleaned\" the room after I'd been there one of my three nights, even though I didn't order this extra service. But there was a fresh towel and the trash was emptied. I'm staying in a Travelodge in Manchester as I write this -- another very basic bargain chain. And though I've only paid half the price of the easyHotel, it's far, far superior. So, I'm all for budget hotels, but the easyHotel really isn't much better than a hostel in my book. The capsule-hotel thing can be done well (see the Yotels), or it can be done shabbily. EasyHotel's definitely the latter.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":2,"Value":2,"Rooms":2,"Location":3,"Cleanliness":2,"Check in / front desk":2},"date":"2012-04-07 04:20:46 +0300","author":"Benjamin Ferry"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-122.4051,"lat":37.7849},"free_breakfast":false,"email":"reservations@themosser.com","phone":"+1 415 986-4400","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":"54 4th St","description":"Nice, clean hotel with small rooms but a great location."}

The hotel is a short taxiride away from the airport and is located opposite of a shopping mall (one in which you won't get lost), in which you will find common retail brands, a food court and a huge supermarket. Furthermore it is a 5min walk away from the Dubai Metro which will basically bring you to most attractions in Dubai (Dubail Mall, Mall of the Emirates, Burj Khalifa etc) I arrived pretty early in Dubai and was happy to be able to check-in at 10am. One positive aspect was that they indeed provided me with a room that I requested. A few weeks before my stay I messaged them asking for a room on a higher floor facing the Burj Khalifa side (only visible on clear days though), and that is exactly what I got. The rooms are a typical Ibis size, not too big, but for me it was more than enough. It is clean and looked fresh, and that's all that I hoped and asked for. As previosly mentioned there is no free internet in the room. I just checked my mails in the lobby where you'll find wireless as well as 3 PC's.

First off, I do write long reviews so bear with me. We didn't have a great deal of money and were staying in Dubai for three nights. As much as we'd have loved to find the deal a friend of mine found (six nights at Atlantis, with flights, for £600 - unfortunately his wife went and booked a week in Wales) we asked our travel agent to find us the cheapest there was, and he found this - the Ibis Deira City Centre. Some relatives actually had stayed there a year before and found it very nice and in a great location. So off to Dubai we go! We'd actually flown to Melbourne, done some stuff there, then to Sydney, and now Dubai on the way back to Manchester. In order to save some more money we were actually flying into Abu Dhabi and travelling into Dubai on a coach but that's another story. Long plane flight, coach trip and then taxi ride later we arrived at probably about 9am. Fair enough. The hotel is actually on a main road (isn't everything in Dubai?) and is opposite the Deira City Centre shopping mall. Although check in isn't until 2pm we go in anyway and try our luck. As luck would unfortunately have it, nothing is available. The staff did say we could try at 1pm and see if there's anything then, so plus marks there for the staff offering that, and minus luck marks for us. The staff did offer to hang onto our luggage for us, which we were grateful for, and we went to the shopping centre to $@!#% a few hours, then came back at 1-ish and found that a room was available. I must mention that, despite being billed as \"very cheap\" according to the travel agent, the standards were very good. The hotel foyer looked clean with three PCs set up for use and international newspapers. The room was also nice - plenty of space, a decent enough bed and a spacious bathroom with walk-in shower and line to hang towels on. Definitely better than expected. Only real problem was that I was woken up at 5am (I think) by what I assume is the \"call to prayer\". Never mind - that's an issue with Dubai itself, not the hotel as the noise was coming from outside. The view from where we were was also pretty good - you could see across the shopping mall to the Burj Khalifa (definitely something worth doing). The TV also picked up a large amount of TV stations, along with a lot of western stuff (given the amount of nudity there is in True Blood you would have thought it wouldn't be screened, but there it is). The breakfast was also decent - an okay variety of warm and cold food including breads, cereals, sausages, beans, toast, juice and others. Nothing spectacular though it was better than the comparatively bland breakfasts I'd had at other places on our trip in Australia. Though check out was at about 10am we were flying back at 2am and so would need our luggage held until about 9pm (otherwise we couldn't do anything and would die of boredom). Again, the hotel kindly held our luggage for us until we came back and used a taxi (they're everywhere in Dubai! Just walk out of the hotel and there's normally three there waiting!) to get to the airport. I will briefly note that, though it didn't affect us, the hotel does not have swimming facilities, though for a small supplement you can use the facilities at the neighbouring Novotel. We found this hotel to be in a good spot - again, across the road from the Deira City Centre shopping mall (good for all your shopping needs, though nowhere near as spectacular as the Dubai Mall) and about three minutes walk from a metro station. Taxis were available and we found the neighbourhood (well, our short walks to the metro) to be one where we felt safe (having said that, Dubai is supposed to be one of the safest places around). The hotel was good value - nothing spectacular, but it's not going to be. The breakfast was good and it had all the amenities necessary. I wasn't sure whether to award a three or a four star. I think that, for the price and value for money, as well as the helpfulness of the staff (they did try to help when we asked them about Ferrari World and the metro, but unfortunately didn't know much about them) I think I'll award it four.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":4,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":3},"date":"2014-05-15 01:36:08 +0300","author":"Ms. Wyman Huels"},{"content":"I stayed there for 3 nights after a stopover from beijing.

The best part was that they offered a free \"heavy snack\" in the early evening, including beer or wine, so I didn't even have to go out for dinner if I didn't want to. That plus a hot breakafst in the AM at no charge was certainly a bonus. There was a small sundry shop for snacks in the lobby if you wanted something extra. Beware the parking fee however. It is valet only at $32 a pop. I received a call just after check in to see if I needed anything which was appreciated.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-05-13 10:51:10 +0300","author":"Orland Nikolaus"},{"content":"This hotel is less than 2 blocks from the Convention Center, centrally located.

This review is for the Convention Center location, which is situated on top of the partially covered I-5 freeway (not as bad as it sounds). I was on travel for work and stayed three nights. I was impressed by the size and layout of the 1-bedroom suite. It had a separate bedroom with dresser, a \"living room\" with pull-out couch bed, desk and dresser, and a kitchen with stove, dishes, cookware and dishwasher! I didn't do any cooking on this trip but if I were traveling with family this would have been perfect. Bathroom was large, with shower and tub. There wasn't any noise from inside the hotel but my room overlooked the city and there was some street noise. Breakfast was included and there was a moderate spread of cold and hot choices. I think coffee and tea were available 24/7. The hotel is 2-3 blocks from the Convention Center, about 7 blocks from Pike Place Market and even the space needle is walkable distance.

Homewood (now a Hilton after being called Pike Place Suites and Summerfield under previous nameplates) quite simply was the best overall value we could find, and WE really knew where and what to look for. Its location is outstanding for walking, exploring and being right in the thick of the things most really want to \"see\" in Seattle. And if you need to go further, it's ideally situated to do it from. \"Top Marks\" for: Front Desk friendliness/knowledge, Engineer (we had a door lock glitch, so they gave us a quick upgrade 'til getting the room back open), Location (They are easy off I-5 and away from a lot of the one-way hassles of downtown) besides their valet during the week you may get lucky like us and find free parking across the street - from late Saturday through Sunday when meters are off) they're one block from the Wa State Conv Ctr if that's of interest, and only 3 blocks or so from the Regal Theater complex and literally scores of great local and chain restaurants and shops. Finally, it's a straight shot right down Pike about 9 easy blocks to the Pike Place Market \"pig\" entrance. \"Good Job\"s for: Rooms (a bit tired, but nice kitchens, baths, furnishings and comfy Hilton beds), Exercise Room with water cooler, towels, TV and some weights, plus 2xTreadmills, 2xEllipticals, 1 Recumbent Bike - all NEW Precor with Cardio Theater TV's and near-pro gym quality) \"Hot\" Breakfast (better than Denny's but not quite up to Embassy Suites standards - but the price- Free - was right!), Shuttle Service (we didn't use but it was a great itinerary and they were flexible about pick-ups until around 9 pm. Great if you are tired after walking all over the city. Biggest Surprise: The price, just over $100 incl. tax for an admittedly quiet night, just after New Year's. The Last Words...This is a great place to stay if you want a quiet and close-by hotel to kick back (even play pool in their lounge!), with a weekday manager's reception, and to keep some food, drink around your room (big fridge, a microwave and a stovetop, plus a coffee maker and the bonus - Starbucks coffee always hot in the lobby, incl. real creamer. You can buy munchies from their quick selection but there are markets everywhere, including a fairly close QFC supermarket up on Capitol Hill, a mini mart by the Conv. Ctr. and a nice IGA with decent wine prices right down on 3rd Ave. off Pike. If you want to work out and not pay extra, it's a 24-hour fantastic value - so pick the \"off-times\" to avoid any crowds and get a real workout incl. in your room price. Or just head down the hill, to Pike Place, Pioneer Square, or the waterfront. You'll be walking lots, especially back up the hill to the hotel, but there's lots of food and drink along the way to cure what \"ales\" you... \"Top Tips\" nearby from a Local \"Tourist\": Pike Place Pub for beer and magnificent crab-stuffed Salmon filet. Everything's wild, food is best quality, beer brewed there has won awards. McCormick and Schmick's...great drinks, consistently better seafood, reasonable wine list values. Key Lime Pie that is more like cheesecake but puts others to shame! Avoid Rock Bottom, Tap House Grill has a great selection though...Want to see Seattle and its environs from the water - try Argosy Cruises, a family-owned company, and always focused on service and true value. or just hop a WS Ferry!","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2013-01-06 13:20:50 +0300","author":"Shawn Jaskolski"},{"content":"This was my 2nd stay at this hotel and it was great.

I chose this hotel because of its free parking and within walking distance to the tram. I got a room over twice the size of my previous night's room and very modern. The room was setup perfectly for a business customer. with a nice, long desk. The rooms are quiet. The hotel is in the pathway of the airport, and I could not hear the jets. It had a hot water pot, cups, glasses...and a towel warmer. The staff was very nice and offered me places to visit and eat. They even looked up the hours of certain museums that I wanted to visit with very little prompting. They had printouts and maps so that I didn't have to try to remember how to get from the hotel to the tram stop and what number/stop name it was. The walk to the tram was a nice walk, however, had the weather been miserable, it would have been a miserable walk. I was told that the area was safe to walk in, even after dark. I walked from the tram back to the hotel and the neighborhood was quite quiet.

Its about a 15 minute walk to Zuid train station (1 stop from Schiphol) which also has a metro service which goes towards Centraal . If you turn to your left after leaving the hotel, then take the first right, tram number number 5 can be found slightly over 5 minutes walk away. This service goes through Museumplein,Leidseplein and onto Centraal. If you buy an advance ticket giving unlimited travel for between 1 to 3 days, the cost is very reasonable. The NH Musica is in Amsterdam's financial area and seems to be geared towards business travellers. The very large rooms have a crisp,modern feel and the bathroom is also immaculate with plenty of room. All the hotel's staff were very helpful without being intrusive. One of the previous reviews mentioned the cost of items in the minibar; everything is between 4 and 6 euros. This shouldn't be a concern as there is an Albert Heijn supermarket about a minute away. I got a very good deal on this hotel through Traveline (about Â£50 per night) and have nothing but good things to say about it. However, if you have never been to Amsterdam before and are travelling alone, do not venture into the red light district alone after dark as, even if you don't have any intention of indulging in any of the seedier things that go on, someone will approach you with an offer to sell substances illegal even there.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":4,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2012-04-21 18:02:46 +0300","author":"Seamus Paucek IV"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lon":-122.4004,"lat":37.7854},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":null,"vacancy":true,"free_parking":true,"price":null,"address":"181 3rd St","description":"Another major convention center hotel, with lots of amenities and very nice rooms."}

The kitchen and living room are very large and brand new -- you feel like you are in a NYC loft apartment. (I was hoping they would upgrade us to a \"Bay View\" and I asked several times -- but it was fine having CIty view since we rarely looked out the windows.)

Also, a Starbucks and the Buena Vista Restaurant is 2 blocks away (where the first Irish Coffee was \"invented\" or brought to the States -- advice-- go for the Irish Coffee - but DO NOT eat a meal there -- not very good!). The water is literally 2 blocks away or less. And there are 2-3 bike rental stores also right around the corner. This is a Fabulous place to stay with kids and the Wharf area has great things for kids to do. But you can still get around to other parts of the city and there is a Cable Car stop one block away as well. Breakfast is included -- They have a lovely comfy breakfast room (with upholstered chairs) and also a great outdoor patio with coal fire pit, which we sat by every morning (in light jackets) and ate our breakfast -- alone -- it was as if we owned a huge house in downtown San Fran. The Breakfast is really nice -- coffee, fresh juices, 3 kinds of cereal, very nice fresh fruit, an assortment of bagels and muffins. (Might have been some boiled eggs.) We ate there all 4 mornings and were quite satisfied with it. One of our best experiences was that they have a \"House Car\" which we used every day and it was always available when we needed it. The first day we were driven to the Alcatraz Ferry and our driver (I wish I could remember his name he was so nice) decided to give our boys a thrill so he drove us down a few winding, bumpy streets, including Lombard (most crooked street)!! He did this even though it was a bit out of the way to our destination but we had time and just loved the adventure! That that started our morning off with a bang and the boys were thrilled. It saved my husband and I having to walk them down it the next day! The hotel also gives a Wall Street Journal or New York Times each morning and the staff could not have been nicer and more helpful.

This was a very bad experience and a bit of a throw back to the 70's after 30 minutes I decided to go have a look at what else was available. I luckily found the Fairmont on Nobhill and for $150 got an amazing room with a view of the bridge and alcatraz. We were only staying in the bay for a night as it was our honeymoon and planned a big tour of america over 5 weeks. I was lucky enough to see an advert for Ghirardelli Square and booked that for our last two nights prior to departure. It was truly the send off we needed after a fantastic tour fo the states, driving from San Fran to Portland, to Missoula montana to yellowstone, jackson wyoming, then to vegas, death valley, yosemite, santa barbara and then back to san fran. The highlights for context were. No 1. Four Seasons Santa Barbara.(hard to beat watching hummbirds whilst drinking a coktail and watching the waves come crashing in from the Pacific.) No 2 Fairmont Ghiradelli Square for the unbelievable room. No 3 Spotted horse Ranch, Jackson. No 4 Paws Up Ranch , Montana.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2013-05-11 04:34:57 +0300","author":"Mekhi Crooks"},{"content":"We stayed for nearly a week at the Fairmont and would highly recommend it! We arrived early in the day, but they graciously stored our luggage while we did some sightseeing. Later, Peter, the staff person in charge of the wine room, graciously served us wine on the terrace while we waited for our room to become available! All of the staff members were very congenial, and the concierge staff was particularly helpful. We found the complimentary house car to be very helpful (within a 2 mile radius), and the drivers generally very friendly. The 2-bedroom residence we stayed in couldn't have been more beautiful or convenient. The terrace, firepit, and gazebo were just steps outside our door along with daily serenades from the musicians below in Ghirardelli Square. The view of the bay was spectacular from our room, and we often used the table and chairs just outside our door to read the complimentary newspaper that was delivered daily. A delicious breakfast with lots of fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt, pastries, etc. was also complimentary, as well as a wine and cheese happy hour and games/puzzles! The beds and pillows were very comfortable, the kitchen well-stocked with daily necessities, and there were three large flat screen TV's. Unfortunately we couldn't figure out how to use the bedroom TV's except with DVD's - we discovered on the last day that the controls were concealed in a nightstand panel - who knew!?. The bathrooms were lovely, though a solid door separating them from the bedrooms would be more conducive to sleep for anyone remaining in bed while the bathroom was in use (the doors had frosted glass panels). The frosted panels would be more useful on the shower doors for a bit of privacy when someone else came through to use the separate water closet. There was also some street noise from pedestrians on the street-side of the hotel. Overall, the bay view, terraces, location, amenities and staff made it the perfect place to stay in San Francisco!","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2012-01-27 05:17:18 +0300","author":"Dr. Britney Abshire"},{"content":"Really could not be better.

We chose the Fairmont Heritage Place largely on the strength of the TripAdvisor reviews and were not disappointed. The location is great for sight-seeing and there are lots of good restaurants within an easy walk. As for our three bedroom apartment, it was almost ridiculously well-appointed and comfortable: gorgeous, well-equipped kitchen, spacious living room, good mattresses, three baths, multiple TVs, hardwood floors, and everything gleaming with cleanliness. The staff was among the most pleasant and efficient we've had the pleasure of dealing with anywhere in our travels, without being in any way obtrusive. I should also mention that our kids loved the long list of DVDs they could borrow from the hotel's video library to watch after dinner in the evenings. Although some reviews have mentioned traffic noise, we didn't notice any to speak of from our apartment and slept well each of the several nights we spent here. Bottom line: we will look forward to coming back here again!","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2014-08-02 15:23:59 +0300","author":"Rusty Beer"},{"content":"We pulled up in the taxi from the airport in late August and a very friendly doorman approached, opened the car doors and said a hearty welcome. We entered the sedate-looking brick building and the lobby was incredibly calm and sparing...hmm, I thought. Then a couple of well-mannered, friendly Fairmont staffers immediately greeted us and gave us the lowdown about the one-bedroom cityview unit I'd booked at a comparatively low price several months earlier (less than $350) for me and my two teenagers in tow...and then staff proceeded to tell me we'd been upgraded at no cost to a two-bedroom cityview unit! Yo! Well, OK! We were pleased, without question! The building is more like a condominium property than a hotel, so it's rather quiet and there aren't tons of folks hanging around. I liked that. And then the unit itself, well, it was gorgeous. The full kitchen gleamed, with a center isle and sufficient pots and pans, silverware, dishes, a medium-sized drawer-type refrigerator, an icemaker and a small dishwasher (I rarely used any of this stuff except for tea-making!), The living room was genuinely spacious and comfortable with a lovely couch and a few chairs and a big ol' flat screen TV atop a gas fireplace. The bedrooms were also quite spacious and each had its own large TV and bathroom - one, even, with a jet-stream-type tub...VERY nice! I like firm mattresses and these were a tad bit less than firm, but my teens thought the beds heavenly, so I'm sure you will, too! We also loved the continental breakfast...boiled eggs, pastries, toast, fresh fruits, orange juice, milk were the major offerings and, of course, coffee and tea. The late afternoon 4pm-5pm refreshment bar of red/white wines and sodas and cheeses/crackers was also a nice touch. Again, it seemed like there were never many folks around, although we knew there were...they just - like us - stayed largely in their own units and enjoyed the amenities there! However, note that the property also has a great deck facing the San Francisco waters and this deck has lovely firepits in the evening that blaze seemingly all night, with plenty of outdoor furniture on which to lounge about... One of the best features of the Fairmont is that it's intimately connected to the Ghirardelli Square shopping square...a small, high-end place with lots of fun little shops and wine-tasting places and some good restaurants. This square was extremely close to the water and within immediate walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf. What's not to like???!!! We loved it and the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The Fairmont town car came in very handy when my teens decided to catch a night movie in the city. The staff's attention to ensuring their safe arrival and pick-up was much appreciated by me. The only downside of note, and there was only one and I feel like I should mention it to be genuine, was that the city view wasn't exactly a skyline-type view...it was of smaller-type rowhouses immediately across the street. Now we were on the second floor, so keep that in mind. It wasn't a Ghirardelli Square high-end-type view, but it wasn't bad, either. And the windows have some super nice curtains including pulldowns that let light in but keep outsider viewers out. I easily found ways to arrange these to my absolute satisfaction. So book yourself in this place, without hesitation! Would we return...you bet we would!!! :)","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":4,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2012-05-27 08:02:12 +0300","author":"Dr. Daron Krajcik"},{"content":"I booked this Hotel after it's rave reviews on Trip Advisor.

All appliances were state of the art, and our room also had a Bosch washer and a separate dryer, which was really helpful. The apartment itself was very spacious, with large windows, automatic blinds, 3 large high-def LCD screens, cable TV with 100's of channels, DVD players - as well as a gas heater in the living area! We loved it so much we wished that we lived at Fairmong Heritage Place Ghirardelli Square. Also downstairs, there are 3 or 4 Ghirardelli chocolate cafe's and shops, which were fantastic. There are several restaurants as well as specialty shops at the Square, and it's only a short walk from the Fisherman's Wharf itself. Staff were fantastic, with the concierge doing everything he could to accommodate to our requests, from in-room dining, to arranging a in-residence masseuse for my wife. The Maserati town car was absolutely fantastic as well, as it took us to Union Square, shopping areas, or other restaurants that are a just a bit too far to walk to.

We chose it because we wanted to eat at Gretzky's for supper and then visit the Hockey Hall of Fame and the CN Tower in the morning. The location was good for us but it is definitely not the nicest area of town. The hotel is beautifully decorated, very modern and the restaurant was great for breakfast. Our check in experience was not great. They told us in a very rude tone and with attitude that our credit card had been declined over the last few days and that they had tried it several time so we would have to provide a cash deposit. Now, keep in mind that this is the third Hilton we had stayed at in three days and the other two had no issue and also my husband is a Gold member. Anyway, we called visa and it turns out that the Hotel had been entering the wrong expiry date. Their fault, not ours, no apology from them. Another issue I had is that we always ask for a room on an upper floor, this is the only Hilton on our entire trip that did not honor our request. They only put us on the 8th floor. It was a very noisy Saturday night as there was lots of partying going on in the streets till 3 or 4 in the morning and we could hear it loud and clear.

We had booked well in advance to get the special tariff - 15 per cent off. The booking process was as easy as could be. A week before our arrival we got a welcoming email promising the nice 1.8 by 2 metre bed and the free minibar. Sounded nice. When we arrived the checkin process was fast and so we arrived to see our room which was clean and furnished in a modern style. Black glass dominates the bathroom section. However, while laying ourselves to rest we started to doubt that the bed really was 1.8m wide. In fact, it was just 1.4m which meant that we had been given a single room. Well, we didn't complain because we really just spent the nights there but having had a glimpse at the \"normal\" rooms we were - understandably - a bit jealous. Well, next time I would complain because I find it quite cheeky that people who book the discount rates get lower quality rooms. If this is company policy then I'd rather stay away from AC hotels. The wifi internet access is provided via a prepaid card which can be obtained at the reception. The good thing about it is that you get access for 24 hrs - as in our case - for three days. If you don't access the net you wouldn't get charged. The free minibar is stocked up everyday and provides you with pops and water.

We had a few niggles, but nothing severe enough to drop this review to a 4. Service was outstanding. We had a problem with our initial room, and were kindly moved to a one-bedroom suite with balcony, which inevitably colours our review. The room was genuinely a luxury experience - a step above similar accommodation we have had in Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton properties in the US. The mis-steps were as follows: The hotel had arranged a driver from YVR, who duly met our flight as arranged, but had managed to lose his car keys. Fortunately he was still able to get into and start the car, but any amusement faded when we stopped not once but twice so he could tie down the trunk with his belt. This added significantly to our journey time, not ideal coming in at midnight from Las Vegas. Market at Jean-Georges was hit and miss, or to be more precise as breakfast was included in our rate: miss-hit-miss-miss (the fifth day we had a dawn train to Seattle; the hotel kindly provided pastries and fruit (which was then confiscated by Customs at the station)). As I think someone else pointed out, a lot depends on your server - maybe we were just unlucky 75% of the time. However, we experienced similar service issues at several restaurants; maybe it's a Vancouver thing. My final gripe is being charged $12 for an espresso by the pool. It was from a automatic machine and not even any good. Overall, however, an experience I would recommend, and would probably stay here again if in Vancouver. The pool was a bonus (though not exactly a sun-trap) and we used Chi Spa which was very relaxing.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-03-09 20:43:59 +0300","author":"Lessie Kuvalis"},{"content":"This is my favorite hotel in Vancouver !!

The hotel rooms occupy the first 15 floors with luxury condos on the rest. The staff were very helpful and the front desk staff (on the lower level than the street level) were very nice and quick regarding checkin. They complementary upgraded our room to a balcony suite. This room was incredible! Very modern and luxurious with quite a few high tech ad ons such as push button drapes and dimming lights. The room was very clean and well kept as was the rest of the decor. The work out facilities where top of the line and very nice. The restaurant, Market, was great. We ate breakfast there the next morning. The apricot sausage was phenomenal! In the process of eating I managed to dump my coke all over myself. The restaurant manager, Gordon Hay, was near and came over to assist, switching chairs, picking up ice from everywhere and even had the chef retire some new food due to my original food having coke on it. We started talking to Mr Hay and he was a real wealth of knowledge regarding the local area and took the time to locate a map and answer our tourist questions as well as make some local recommendations as to what to do in the area. He was very personable and helpful and was a true crowning touch to the overall great experience of the hotel.

We had heard so many wonderful things and were very excited. Our good friend Jeffrey Victor happens to be one f the concierges at the Hotel (although he was not working the night we stayed) and arranged to have a fabulous corner suite (the view rooms were all sold out by the time I booked) with a nice bottle of wine and fruit basket awaiting our arrival. It was one of those 550+/- SF units with a bar area and living room, and office with a flat screen TV (in both rooms) and even a TV in the bathroom MIRROR!!??!! The marble bathroom might have one questioning if there was any marble left in the world?! Flood to ceiling and heated floors! We didn't want to leave the room but I promised my wife some shopping on Robson before New Years dinner so off we went. When we came back, we just relaxed, watched some TV and enjoyed our bottle of wine until our late seating (9:30) at The Market restaurant down below. The restaurant was below our expectations due to the poor service. There were far too many people for such an intimate 6 course set-menu that we weren't eating our main until closer to midnight. However, the food was INCREDIBLE! My wife was not feeling like eating at that hour and was pretty full so we ended up taking our food back down to the room to eat the next day. All of our drinks were comped (all 6 of our 11.00 Martinis) for the inconvenience. It was hard to be angry as we didnt have far to go after dinner to get back to our room and the food was amazing after all. The next morning, I hit their state-of-the-art fitness facility for a workout (Damn, that was hard!) and enjoyed a delicious protein shake from their smoothie bar afterward. I went downstairs and next door to the Urban Fair market and grabbed us some delicious breakfast items to bring back to the room and called down for a late check-out (until 1PM). All in all, it was an incredible 24 hrs and we would not hesitate to stay again. It was an oasis in the city.

The room staggering, I have never seen as many buttons to alter the lighting. The bathroom was wonderful and filled with L’Occitane products, yes you are in the city and privacy could be problem, but you have automatic blinds so who cares. A separate bath and shower are provided and two sinks so travelling with a partner makes getting ready a simple affair, a separate dressing room for all your cases keeps the main bedroom neat and tidy. So are there any issues, well yes, it is noisy, we stayed on the ninth floor and could not believe that an inner city hotel had such poor sound proofing, our room was on the corner of Thurlow and Alberni, it was so bad we could get to sleep until 4 in the morning, we did mention this at check out and got a very negative response as though it was impossible that anything could be wrong with the hotel.

The underground arrival is slightly weird but very efficient and I was escorted up to my 'upgraded' suite. I had book a deluxe corner king with balcony and was given a suite that, whilst beautifully appointed, had the most odd proportions and NO balcony. Many of the things one comes to expect from Shangri-La in Asia were in place - I took breakfast in my room each morning and it was beautifully presented and perfectly prepared, the bathroom was almost as big as the sitting room and was wonderfully appointed. The bedroom had a huge (50\"?) wall TV. It was so huge that the only place from where you could properly view it was in bed! When you take the elevator to the lobby you find yourself in a rather strange granite sided 'void' or that's at least how it feels. I took lunch one day at Market and it certainly lived up to Jean-George's East Coast reputation. In summary, certainly worth the special deal that I booked but will find it difficult to justify the racj rate of anything close. It's a very good addition to the Vancouver scene and may help bring the standard of other 'wannabe' properties (q.v. the Grande Residences at Sutton Place) up to scratch.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":4,"Value":3,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2014-04-25 04:00:09 +0300","author":"Kurt Barton"},{"content":"The hotel was very nice, new and clean.

However, the reviews on Tripadvisor do not do it justice. This hotel is truly a little gem in a huge city such as Phoenix. The impressive service started at the airport where our shuttle driver offered us cold water from a cooler. It went down very well considering we had arrived in the early evening and temps were still hovering around 100F. On arrival, the evening desk clerk was extremely welcoming and friendly, even throwing in a free breakfast buffet when we asked. Warm freshly-baked cookies were also offered as well. The room was a decent size, and nicely decorated with an extremely comfortable bed. The only downside is when we arrived to our room, there were dirty dishes and trays from breakfast on the hallway floor right at our door. When we mentioned it to the clerk, they were taken away promptly with apologies. Location-wise, it is in a deserted area maybe bordering on seedy. However, it is very safe walking around the area, albeit a bit deserted. Other reviewers noted there is an In and Out Burger \"right across the street\" when in reality, it is 5 miles away. There is really nothing nearby food-wise within walking distance, except for a Bill Johnson's Big Apple a short walk away, which offers decent diner food with good service. We didn't try the hotel restaurant other than the buffet breakfast in the morning. The breakfast is excellent with great choices and the hotel serves one of the best omelets we've ever had, hands down. From check-in to check-out, the staff at this hotel can't do enough for you, always smiling, pleasant and professional. In reality if Phoenix were our destination we would probably choose a more central hotel, but for arriving at the airport to go to other destinations this is absolutely going to be our go-to place to stay. Kudos to the management and staff for such a great accommodation.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":3,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-01-24 00:19:28 +0300","author":"Hardy Kozey"},{"content":"On the north side of the airport in an industrial area of Van Buren, so location is not the best, BUT, for the early am flight out, it was ideal.

The pool has had a fresh coat of paint and is looking good! The bathrooms look like they have had the tub/showers re-lined and there is new tile, looking good Champions! I would like to take a minute and talk about a unique feature of this hotel the fields outback. They have baseball fields and soccer / football area and courts, a nice feature when you are there with a team and could use a place to work out or you want to keep up your skills during a summer vacation. The grass on the soccer field was lush it felt like you were walking on a carpet, no holes and nice and level. A+ And for those of you who like to kick back with a magarita and some home made nachos you need to swing by the bar and get some of their awesome nachos! Even if you dont get the magarita get the nachos the kids were at Disney and talking about cant wait to get back and get some of those nachos again LOL Once again we have been back 5+ times since December and everytime has been great!

The staff was great, the room was clean, towels were nice... Daily cleaning service. Beds and pillows were comfortable. Beds didn't \"creak\" which was nice since I got up a few times at night with my 14 month old while my husband and older son slept in the same room. Air conditioning was loud! Everything about the hotel was good (not fancy, but clean). The only downside was since this is a budget hotel it draws a different standard of people... kind of rough crowd, which is not our style. We had guests above us and out at the pool that were screaming and yelling until late at night. They were having fun in the pool without any regard to other guests sleeping. I did call the front desk at 10pm since it was so loud I couldn't even sleep with earplugs. They sent security over right away and the noise by the pool died down shortly thereafter. At 12 o'clock at night I could still hear the people above us banging around while I had earplugs in, but I didn't call security for that. The next day I asked the front desk if the guests above us had checked out (and luckily they had!!!) or I would have asked to switch rooms our second night. The pool outside was very pleasant, the indoor pool temp was like a hot tub (well, not quite, but pretty darn hot for a pool). I might consider staying here again if the price was the deciding factor, but based on the clientele we would probably opt for a higher grade place for more money with the hopes that the clientele would be of a higher standard too :)","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2012-08-24 01:25:15 +0300","author":"Van Corwin"},{"content":"I stayed here from 04/24 to04/28 the rooms were clean had no problem with that.

One was not immediately available but we were told to come back after noon. There was still not one available. We asked the next day and a different front desk person (this time male not female) said one was not available but \"let's see what I can do\". He did his computer thing and switches some things around and we got a great ground floor room by the pool. So, sometimes it is not the hotel but who is at the desk that counts. We stayed 14 days and found the staff very friendly and helpful (except for the 1st female desk person we encountered). We stayed around the hotel for 4 of the 14 days and just used the pool which felt like a warm to hot bath. The spa was great and the one time it was not very hot they fixed it within the hour. We used the laundry twice and it was not very expensive with quite a few machines. We did not have to wait either time. Yes we could complain about the noise outside, but that was just kids having fun and if we wanted quiet we would not have chosen a room by the pool. We could complain about them closing down the pool when the bacteria count got to high but they treated it and reopened by the next morning and this is better than making us sick from the pool. I read the reviews before we left and found most of the complaints had no validity. You can not blame the hotel for the weather or guests noise or attitude or behavior. So all I can say is all the staff were friendly and most were helpful. The rooms were clean, the towels were fluffy. The price was certainly right.

I complained to the manager, Ms. Laura Lamblin, who told me that I had to go to the police station (WHERE???HOW DO I GET THERE???) and file a report. Well...for one I didn't have the time because I had transatlantic flight to catch and also, I do not speak French. The incident was very upsetting, but worst of all was the way that I was treated. Ms. Lamblin was supremely rude (doing a disservice to the reputation of Parisians, such a cliche') and decided that the best way to solve the problem was to issue a 'certificate' stating that my lingerie bag was \"accidently' thrown in the rubbish bin by the cleaning staff. And how does that exempts the hotel of any responsibility??????? Also, you had to be a moron not to see that my silk bag was full of barely worn expensive underwear.

The location was great, easy to get to all the tourist sights and great for going out in Greenwich Village or the Meatpacking District in the evenings. We arrived after a long delayed journey and were relieved to arrive at the hotel, the lobby is smart and well presented and we had a nice welcome by the man at reception who gave us maps of the city and a quick orientation. The room was small but we were expecting this and as we were planning to be out and about a lot it wasn't really a problem. It was a bit beaten up with marks on the wall and our window faced a wall but it was generally clean. Overall it was pretty good for the price we paid, we got a really good deal on Expedia but there are a couple of small things that could really help make it better. There was no welcome pack etc in the room so we had to ask what time we needed to check out and didn't know about some of the hotel facilities. There was only one robe provided even though there were 2 of us. This was mentioned when we checked in but no reason was given as to why, it didn't really matter as we didn't even use it but it was a bit odd. There was a small bottle of water provided (again only 1) which was in the room when we checked in, we drank it the night we arrived but were never given another one. Again not the end of the world but would have been nice if it had been replenished. The safe was really difficult to use, you had to pay for it and swipe your credit card to open and close it, which could take a while as you had to swipe it at exactly the right speed. None of these things were major problems but they're just small touches that could be easily fixed to make the overall experience a bit better. All in all I would stay there again for the location and the fact that it was a good price. As long as you're not expecting 5 start the GEM hotel is a good bet.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":4,"Value":4,"Rooms":3,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":3,"Sleep Quality":3},"date":"2014-09-16 00:12:26 +0300","author":"Madisyn Nitzsche"},{"content":"This hotel is extremely well situated and is very near (one block) to two different metro stations and several different lines, which makes travelling up or downtown easy. Loads of coffee shops, delis and restaurants within walking distance. The hotel is clean, and linen and towels changed daily if you wish. Front desk staff are courteous. There was some noise from traffic, but I would say this was not intrusive and adds to the NY atmosphere you love in this exciting town! The not-so-good news? The room is compact and the bed is very small - 4' x 6' at the most - ours was also fixed against one wall making it even more of a crush! We had difficulty securing the door to the room, but reported this to the front desk who we trust fixed it in time this for the next guests.

The staff were friendly enough until we said we wanted to change the booking to one night so we could find something of better value and then they were pretty cold. Overall the service was pretty average. Despite the price we couldn't make a cup of tea in the room which is annoying. The location is good however. We ended up finding a bigger place of slightly better quality in Midtown near Times Square for about $60 a night less. Overall I would not recommend this place. In fairness they were quite good about releasing us from the 48 hour cancellation fee and did not charge us for the next night which they were within their rights to do. Had the rooms been a little bigger I think we'd have been happier. Being told somewhat sarcastically by the staff, \"well this is New York\" didn't help matters and set the tone for our stay. I'd have to say we are not nomally critical and that friendly, helpful staff can make a dingy place tolerable.

The area around the hotel is known for housing offices (lawyers and the like) so it is busy during the day, but very quiet at night. One bonus is that finding parking in the evening is not very difficult. The Vatican and Castel Sant'Angelo are mere minutes by foot, and most other major sights can be reached within 15 minutes on foot. The hotel is very modern and the rooms are large and comfortable. I was upgraded to a suite, which was even nicer. The bed was large and very comfortable with many pillows of various sizes. The room had a large desk with wired internet, a sofa and a minibar. It is very easy and comfortable to work in the room. The bathroom was of impeccable quality and adequate size. It has a bidet for all those who use them. The ladies at the front desk were very helpful and spoke good English. One disappointment was the breakfast. Whereas the selection of food was large and varied (eggs, bacon, sausage, cold cuts, cheeses, croissants, etc.) the coffee (espresso & cappucino) was not good. I expect better in an Italian hotel. As you can tell from by sole, relatively insignificant complaint, this is a first rate hotel and I'd return in a heartbeat.

I researched a lot of hotels in the Fisherman's Wharf area, but was so glad we chose the Cow Hollow area instead. Fisherman's Wharf just seems an area of slightly tacky tourist restaurants and snack bars, \"seaside resort\" souvenir shops and chain hotels, whereas Cow Hollow was full of great restaurants and shops. I looked for a nice restaurant for our last night and was overwhelmed with choice - ISA, Betelnut, A16, to name but a few. We ended up at Bistro Aix which was excellent.

I had read the excellent reviews on Tripadvisor and they had prompted me to book the hotel. The price was reasonable, the location absolutely brilliant (best and prettiest part of the city) and the hotel was immaculately clean. However, what made the hotel OUTSTANDING was the quality of the service. All members of staff were polite, efficient and friendly, but Fatih really was the icing on the cake. He helpfully answered several emails before we travelled and almost felt like a friend by the time we arrived. We have travelled extensively and have received good service on many occasions, but our experience with Fatih went well beyond. He was an absolute delight. Breakfasts were delicious and completely fresh, taken on the delightful roof terrace overlooking the Bosphorus. There are lots of very good restaurants on the street round the corner from the hotel. We found them to be of a very high quality, reasonably priced and service was very good. There are also lots of small mini-markets for water and the hotel is happy for you to buy alcohol to take back to the hotel (there is no bar) which can be drunk in your room or up on the roof terrace. We flew into Sahiba Gocken airport and used the Havas bus as far as Taksim Square, then got a taxi to the Aya Sophia which is just a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The journey took us about 2 hours due to the traffic. However, I would recommend using one of the local travel agents and booking a return minibus shuttle with them. It worked out slightly cheaper but was so much more convenient, picking us up from the hotel and, despite a few pickups on the way, delivered us back to the airport in half the time. All in all, a fabulous stay in a brilliant hotel and I just wished we'd had room in our suitcases to bring Fatih home with us!","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2014-09-06 06:10:28 +0300","author":"Lenore Blick"},{"content":"I just left the Osmanhan hotel where I enjoyed two nights with friends.

This part of the city is understandably a little noisy, as it is the center of tourism for Istanbul, but where the hotel is located, the noise is not excessive.

It was so small my daughter took a picture and posted it to her Facebook page and got several comments. We had no problem with the shared bathroom, didn't run into anyone else using it. We prefer to stay at inexpensive, clean hotels that are in great neighborhoods because it allows us to travel more often. We also enjoy quirky places with lots of character and try to avoid the big chains whenever possible. In NYC there is so much to do we only use our hotel room for sleep.

It was very much like my college dorm, but cleaner and quieter. The bathroom was very clean and even though this was a busy time, I never waited for a toilet or shower. My only complaint is the male guests who think it is ok to go into the bathroom wearing their boxers or tighty whities. The hotel rooms comes with a nice bathroom guys, USE IT. No one wants to see you in your underwear. The staff was OUTSTANDING. I have stayed in some of NYC's finest hotels and have never experienced such professional, friendly service. I hope the management realizes how valuable their staff is and that they make the experience. Robert, Ashley and the other desk girl with big glasses (sorry, I can't remember her name) were awesome !! No, I did not experience bedbugs.

Me & my friend were on the second leg of a trip to Toronto and New York and had been travelling for 12 hours on a Greyhound and just wanted to dump our bags, get a shower and get back out to see the sights. When we got there the hotel staff were really friendly, helpful and speedy. We got up to our floor and got a bit lost with the layout. The number of the room was not on the key so it got a bit confusing when we got the room number wrong. We got to the room and could not believe how small it was! There was the two bunk beds and then about a foot of space in between the beds and the wall/mirror. Therefore we couldn't get dressed at the same time. Have to say though, this made the last day easier as we had to keep our suitcases packed the whole time! I was aware it would be shared bathrooms before going so that was not an issue. But I was glad that I never had to wait for a toilet or a shower which was really good. The beds are pretty comfy, the hotel is pretty quiet and there was a tv that each bed could see but ran by one remote. Beds are made every day and new towels provided daily. Also you are provided with a bathrobe and slippers. Showers are fitted with shampoo/conditioner/shower gel dispensers and the bathrooms have hairdryers fitted. On our last day the hotel staff were super friendly and kept our luggage for the day and booked us a taxi to the airport. All in all I wouldn't recommend this hotel as, even though you don't spend a lot of time in the hotel, you need the space to get ready and keep your stuff! Also, if you don't know New York (which I didn't) and you want to do tourist-y stuff (which I did) it is too far away really from anything and I found the Subway really confusing.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":5,"Value":2,"Rooms":2,"Location":2,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":3},"date":"2013-10-18 00:09:41 +0300","author":"Ashlee Champlin"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-122.4105,"lat":37.7886},"free_breakfast":false,"email":null,"phone":"+1 415 673-6672","vacancy":false,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":"609 Sutter St","description":"A historic hotel with some elegantly appointed rooms and suites.

Over all of stay was fantastic, the place has real character, the rooms are designed to look like sleeper cabins on the old orient express, the one downside of the hotel being that they are sized this was as well. But for a two night stay the limited space is fine. The bathrooms were shared, and even though this worried me a little at first it turned out to be no problem. We never had a problem getting in to use the facilities or take a shower. Now for some info on the shower, it was hands down one of the nicest I have ever used. All the rooms have ipod docks/speakers which was great, I loved being able to put on my music while getting ready to go out. The hotel has a restaurant and bar/club off the lobby, the restaurant which is French inspired and serves food all day, was very good, and I say that as a self proclaimed foodie. They have a good selection of reasonably priced cocktails as well, although the cucumber mint concoction should be avoided unless you are interested in drinking a cucumber. They make an excellent dry gin martini, and the watermelon mimosa was very good. The bar/club on the other side of the lobby, was fantastic. it seems to be a very popular destination at the moment, and they appear to be very controlled about how many people they will allow in, it is a big room decorated with a hodge podge of things, with lots of low velvet chairs and long couches. They seem to only allow as many people as there are places to sit into the bar, which is wonderful allowing for a relaxed intimate environment, the problem is that they have the music volume set just a bit to high, which makes conversation uncomfortable. Four of us met there for drinks after dinner, we had three rounds of very interesting and tasty cocktails (a bit pricey at $15 a pop) and ended up leaving to go to the restaurant for our last round as it would be more comfortable to talk in the there (plus the drinks are more affordable). The location was wonderful, walking distance to everything in the village and to midtown. We walked the couple of blocks to the High Line park as well, an experience not to be missed. Over all I would highly recommend The Jane Hotel to my friends, I don't think I would send my parents there but for well traveled and continental twenty somethings with a little extra money to spend it is a great weekend getaway.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":3,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2012-04-11 11:27:32 +0300","author":"Wilburn D'Amore"},{"content":"Where to start? The Jane is a great little hotel. The rooms are tiny, its like a train or ship cabin â€“ so be warned but you are in NYC so you shouldnâ€™t be spending too much time in them anyway. The room is equipped with A/C & a fan, TV, IPOD dock/alarm clock and safe. The mattress was a little on the thin side as its just a piece of foam but I managed to sleep well during my stay. The shared bathrooms were very clean and there was rarely a wait to use ether a shower or toilet â€“ although it was a little weird to learn that theyâ€™re shared by both male & female guests â€“ although you get used to this pretty quickly. They also provide Shampoo, Conditioner & Body wash in the showers. The location of the hotel was perfect â€“ very close to The High Line & Chelsea market with some great restaurants, bars and shops within walking distance. A few other reviews have mentioned issues with Taxiâ€™s â€“ I didnâ€™t have to wait for one at all during my 10 night stay â€“ a taxi into & around time sq was roughly $10 which I thought was pretty decent. The staff were great, although a couple of them had a little attitude. The one major issue that I did have was the elevator â€“ it hardly worked.

There's a shelf and clothes rail above the bed, draws and luggage space underneath. Views come with the noise of the west side highway, at the back is quieter. My room overlooked a courtyard with trees. AC above the window, and a wall fan. The bathrooms are at the end of each hall, with lockable units for each shower and toilet. I never waited for either. Very nice tiling and rainfall showers. Nice touches: wood panelled rooms, with soft panels around the bed, free replaceable bottled water, old school decor details. The cafe and ballroom closed after the recent licensing controversies. A new cafe is coming soon, looking like a Parisian cafe - may be open by now. About 5% of the rooms on my floor had long term residents in their unrestored rooms. Rooms were a little smelly from the cleaning products used. The beds are right next to the doors, so you hear corridor sounds. Location is excellent - west village, just south of meatpacking, subway a few blocks north at 14th st. Great for $99 in NYC, and a very stylish hotel, in a retro/quirky way.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Value":4,"Rooms":4,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2012-11-17 20:39:32 +0300","author":"Johnnie Rath"},{"content":"Stayed for five days, on the 5th floor, room 542, after reading about it's renovation in New York Magazine.

Good extras: Flat screen TV with DVD, ipod docks, air conditioning. Great staff! Rooms and beds very tiny; similar to all the small hotels I've stayed in in Europe. I didn't experience any bugs, and had minimal conact with postitutes/johns and 'odd' permnament residents, but also met nice European and American guests, too.

The room wasnt overly clean, the sofa was dirty and had crumbs on it and looked like the covers on it needed a wash.

Our first surprise when checking in was the fact that the room rate charged was much higher than what we had booked at - the reception staff attributed it to taxes and other incidentals. Our room was small, had a musty smell and the furnishings were tacky. Standard items like drinking water, glasses and tissue boxes were not provided. The bathroom had no soap or shampoo, instead there was a hair/ body wash which my wife said made her hair texture oily. The shower knob had no hot or cold markings and needed to be turned clockwise, so one had to be very careful to control the water temperature. When I called Housekeeping to send up some glasses they asked me to call the restaurant which i did. Their response? You guessed it - they asked me to call up Housekeeping. Finally, they sent up two plastic glasses. The hotel is located in a very isolated area of Jumeirah with a \"picturesque\" view of the dry docks and no restaurants, shopping, activity spots within walking distance. The only attraction is for beach-lovers because the hotel operates a free shuttle service to the nearby Jumeirah beach. Everywhere else, you have to travel by taxi which ranges from 20 AEDs to 60+ AEDs. The hotel security staff try to push private taxis and city tours which we found were were at least 300% costlier when we compared similar tours offered by agencies advertising in the Official Dubai Tourism magazine available free in the room. The one bright spot of our stay was the helpful Filipino staff at the reception who went out of their way to accommodate our request for early check-in and late check-out. Before leaving, we requested for a weighing scale to check our luggage because we were afraid that we may have over-shopped but once again, we were disappointed being informed that this was a 2 star property and such \"luxury\" items were not available. This was not our first trip to Dubai but it will certainly be our last to Holiday Inn Express, Jumeirah.","ratings":{"Overall":1,"Service":3,"Value":1,"Rooms":1,"Location":1,"Cleanliness":2,"Sleep Quality":3},"date":"2013-02-02 12:28:21 +0300","author":"Mr. Joanie Wyman"},{"content":"very clean and friendly hotel, the staff is very friendly, especialy the reception guy from morocco","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2014-06-06 15:37:31 +0300","author":"Milton Terry"},{"content":"I booked the room by online and it was for accomodating two persons in one room.

You have to go to Westin for the spa as well. The rentals for beach activities like the cabana, snorkeling gear, umbrella is also a bit pricey, but hey, this is Maui.

We went to the Luau which was the best I've ever seen (pay the extra dollars for preferred seating), then saw it again from our Lanai a few days later while dining from room service. Couldn't have been nicer. We ate several times at the b-fast buffet and had dinner several times to watch the hula dancers and live music. The tiki torch lighter even took my boys to help him light the tikis. They LOVED it. What more could a mom want but so much attention for her boys! The staff was so friendly and helpful and seemed to really go the extra mile for us. The only thing that went less than perfect was the day we arrived, we found our room to be very dusty and the bathroom needed a little deep cleaning. They sent staff right up to clean it, the housekeeping supervisor called the next day to be sure everything was satisfactory, and then they had free breakfast coupons delivered for the inconvenience.

The views of the sunset over there were amazing - right over Black Rock. We ate in the restaurant one night for the buffet which was nice, it wasn't gourmet food but was lovely. Everything in Maui seems to shut down and go to sleep at about 11pm, so that's a warning if you like your nightlife! If you go to a restaurant much after 8.30pm you'll find you'll be eating on your own most of the time! The snack bar by the pool did great lunches like Nachos and Burgers but was typically overpriced. The pool and surrounding lawned areas are beautifully landscaped.

This was our 5th trip to Hawaii in the last 7 years. We have stayed at many hotels in Hawaii, including the Ritz Carlton in Maui, and this was one of our favorites. This hotel is fabulous! The grounds are immaculate, the pool is beautiful and the beach is probably the best we've seen. I only have one complaint that I'll get to at the end. First of all, we had a deluxe oceanfront room in Building 6. Anyone who complains about the walk is just a complainer. The walk is not that bad and the views on your way to the beach/pool are beautiful. You do have to take 2 elevators, but they are very fast and it's not that hard to figure out. We had it figured out after the first time. It's absolutely worth the walk to get to Building 6. All the rooms are literally oceanfront with nothing to get in the way of your view. There is the island of Lanai to one side and the island of Molokai to the other side and you can see the lights of Oahu in the far distance. The waves are crashing on the rocks right outside your window. The rooms were pretty good, could definitely be upgraded a little. For the price you pay you expect a walk-in shower, not a shower curtain. It needed a little paint and carpet refresher, but nothing you couldn't live with. We had trouble logging into the high-speed internet in our room, so we called someone to come fix it. We never once complained about it and still we got two food vouchers for $15 a piece for our \"trouble\" to be used at any restaurant on the grounds. The pool was beautiful, very clean and refreshing. Lots of chairs and plenty of room. The resort was pretty dead this time of year, as was the entire island. This is definitely a \"down\" time for them. It was a prefect time of year to go. The beach is amazing. It is all sand bottom with great snorkeling by Black Rock. No big waves this time of year. The beach infront of the Sheraton is the best on Kaanapali. We spent a day exploring the beaches over in Kihei and Wailea (Four Seasons Resort) and the beach at the Sheraton is so much better. We loved that it was a short walk to Whaler's Village area - we ate at Hula Grill twice. We would walk down on the beach and then walk back on the path that is right at the top of the beach. You can walk on the path all the way from the Sheraton to the restaurants in about 5 to 10 minutes. The entire staff was very friendly. The grounds, pool and beach are some of the best we've ever seen. The one BIG complaint I would have is the price of the food at the resort restaurants. We ate dinner our first night at the Lagoon Bar - my husband had an Ahi Sandwich, I had a burger and we each had a Lava Flow drink ($10 each) for a total bill of over $60. We just couldn't believe it. The drinks were not that great and were in small plastic cups. You get twice the amount and better quality at any other restaurant in town for about $7.50. A small plastic cup of soda is $3.75 (no refills). The quality of the food we had was mediocre at best. We only ate at the pool bar once to use our free meal vouchers, otherwise we wouldn't have bothered. Whoever is in charge of running the restaurant portion of this resort doesn't have very good business sense. They would get so much more business if they would lower their prices even a little bit. We're all about relaxing and enjoying drinks, but even we couldn't pay $10 for a small plastic cup of a watered-down drink. We went to Safeway right down the road and stocked up on soda, water, wine, beer and snacks. We would take a small collapsable cooler with water and soda down to the beach every day and fill it with ice and it stayed cold all day. The location of this hotel is perfect. It is a short 5 minute drive to Lahina where there are a ton of amazing restaurants on Front Street. Overall we would recommend this resort to anyone, but would clarify that with making sure not to bother eating there.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Value":4,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2014-03-26 20:27:43 +0300","author":"Dr. Zakary Larson"},{"content":"I booked the Sheraton Maui by what I read on Trip Advisor. It had been over 20 years since I was in Maui last and I had no idea where to stay as there are so many choices and many different areas to stay in. I must say I picked an awesome hotel. We were more than pleased with our choice. The beach is big and beautiful. The black rock right out in front of the hotel is the best place to snorkel. My daughter swam with turtles most days. They are very friendly and come into the snorkel area a few times a day to look for food on the ocean floor. It was fantastic. The rock is also where they have a nightly cliff diving event. There is this guy who lights all the torches around the property. Then he proceeds to the black rock and lights the few torches there. When he is done and the sun has almost set, he dives off the cliff into the water below. It does not look that high, but it is a neat thing that happens each night at sunset. The hotel pool is endless. At first you think that it is just one large pool, but then you realize it wraps around the property sort of like a lazy river. It is peaceful and beautiful and my kids had the best time in the pool. Outside the property we found lots of food choices. Lahaina is close by. About a 5-10 minute drive. Lahaina is the cutest area with lots of restaurants and blocks and blocks of shops. We did not eat at the hotel. We had a car and found food in Lahaina or near the hotel. We paid a AAA rate of 305.00 per night plus an 18.00 resort fee. Our room had a great view of the pool and the ocean beyond that. We were pleased with our room (nice flat screen TV) and also were very happy with the hotel's valet. It was only 5.00 a night and the valet guys were very fun and helpful. Our favorite island has always been Oahu, but now we are in awe of the Sheraton, it's black rock, the turtles, Lahaina and the island of Maui. Without a doubt we would return.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":4,"Value":4,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Check in / front desk":4},"date":"2013-12-26 02:01:33 +0300","author":"Evan Murray"},{"content":"Our final 5 days of vacation were in Maui at the Sheraton. I was really looking forward to checking the property out after having stayed at the Westin 2 years prior. I have never in any of my past travels actually gone through the trouble to ask for a different room. I am typically just happy to be on vacation. =) We had 2 rooms at the Sheraton before we finally landed in Building 6. I really think the rooms need to be re-evaluated as to what their view/description should be. Our first Ocean View was on the second floor and there were multiple plumeria trees growing taller than our balcony. We could only see the beach after standing on one of the chairs on the balcony. I called to explain the issue and they checked into available rooms. They called me back and gave me my new room number in another building and on the top floor (high above the plumeria). We arrived at the new room to find that the view was actually worse. The palm trees were completely obstructing our view of anything (resort, pool, beach) and there was no balcony in this room. This time I went to the desk to talk to them in person and explain that if I was going to receive a garden view room, I would like to at least have my rate adjusted to the garden view rate. We ended up speaking with the evening manager and getting upgraded to building 6. I was a little upset that we were not offered the upgrade prior to spending an hour dragging our luggage around that maze because of our SPG gold status. There was no acknowledgment of our SPG status at check in. Speaking of the Maze... =) I don't know who designed that property but they should have to stay in building 6 just for punishment. It took at least 3 elevators to get anywhere. There were people wondering around holding these little maps they give you at check in. Everyone was lost. It takes a day or two just to figure out what floor or elevator you are supposed to be on to get where you want to go. If it weren't for the snafu on the first day, the resort probably would have been an average stay. The rooms are nice enough though there is only wi-fi in selected public spaces and the pool. The bathrooms were large and clean though they seemed to stop at the tub when they renovated. There is great snorkeling from the beach (great for those leery of snorkeling from a ship in the open ocean). Most of the staff were great. Food prices were typically out of control. We ate in Lahaina quite a bit. They were changing out the lounge chairs around the pool while we were there. The new ones are much nicer and have a cushion. We did have a difficult time finding two chairs together. Lots of people tossing towels on them and then going to the beach. We saw at least 20 chairs in the immediate area that had no one come back to claim the towels. We will be returning to Maui but will not stay at the Sheraton. We found the Westin to be much more accommodating and easier to get around.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":3,"Value":2,"Rooms":3,"Location":2,"Cleanliness":3,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":2,"Check in / front desk":3},"date":"2013-06-26 23:59:07 +0300","author":"Loma Satterfield"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-123.017316,"lat":38.808651},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1 707 894-4535","vacancy":false,"free_parking":false,"price":"$145-259 USD","address":"302 North Main St.","description":"This elegant 1901 Victorian mansion is conveniently located in downtown Cloverdale on a quiet residential street, just blocks from restaurants, shops and the town plaza.

Among the budget hotels, it is the one which is least expensive and I would say that it is a good value for the money. And booking is not so hard, just email the hotel directly and they would do the rest and no credit card is needed, full payment is upon arrival.

They change your towels and linens daily, and the sheets are spotlessly clean and white. you get 2 bottles of drinking water and instant coffee daily. I guess, the next time we go back to singapore, we would stay again at regin hotel. We had a good night sleep after a whole day of walking around and enjoying singapore. Only warning is that when coming from the airport, tell the taxi driver that you are going to sims ave then tell them Regin hotel.

We really wanted to be within walking distance of the cultural sites, so we asked for a 3 star place in the historic district, and we're very glad we decided to stay in the area. The hotel is in a great location - a 5 or 10 minute walk to the Hippodrome, Blue Mosque, Arasta Bazaar, and Grand Palace Mosaics Museum, and about a 15 minute walk to the Aya Sofia, Topkapi Palace, and the Basilica Cistern. It's also a 10-15 minute walk to the tram line and Grand Bazaar. It's on a small side residential street, so you don't get noise from crowds or traffic, which is a plus. There is a view of the Marmara Sea from one side of the hotel and from the outdoor terrace where they serve breakfast. Breakfast is nice - all cold, but a perfectly good start to the day - bread, yogurt, cheese, cold cut meat, tomatoes, olives, fresh fruit, jams, juice, tea, coffee. The rooms were cute - average size (not cramped, not huge), with high wood paneled ceilings, and hardwood floors with an oriental rug. We had asked for a room with two twin beds and got a room with three, which was great. There was a wardrobe and shelves and a TV, as well as a nightstand and lamp. We also had a lot of windows, so the room got nice light, and there were embroidered sheers for privacy. The curtains did a good job of shielding the light in the morning when we were sleeping. The bathroom looked new and had a roomy floor-level shower with lots of hot water and a Western toilet. There is wireless Internet, but we didn't use that since we weren't traveling with our computers, so I can't comment on how well it worked. We only had two complaints. First, the hotel is three floors (no elevator) and has difficult stairs. It's a gorgeous spiral staircase with marble steps, but it's steep and twisty and doesn't have a handrail all along it; plus, there are motion-sensor lights that don't activate until you're halfway up the flight of steps, so you have to navigate in low light sometimes. This was a very minor issue for me as a 20something, but my 60 year old mother had difficulty with it, and I imagine it could be hazardous for the elderly or little kids. The only other issue we had was the bed linens. The beds were only outfitted with a flat (not fitted) sheet on the mattress and a thin blanket. We missed the usual top sheet, and kept having to tuck in and reposition the bottom sheet since it wasn't fitted. I'm guessing this is a local custom, but as exhausted tourists, we would have appreciated Western bedding. Also, the thin blanket wasn't enough for me for the cool nights - however, I used the blanket from the third bed, and I imagine they would have given us an extra one if we had asked. Overall, we felt this was a good value in a great spot, and we liked that it was family-run. It's always nice to support family businesses, and Otkay, the owner, was clearly dedicated. With the addition of a complete handrail on the stairs and Western bedding, this place would be absolutely fantastic!

We chose the place because our needs were simple and the price was excellent for the long memorial day weekend. We would have preferred a place with the free continental breakfast for the convenience as much as cost. For a small amount extra we got a microwave and fridge (happy with that, btw) and the hotel info claimed to have coffee available in the lobby so we figured we could forgo the free breakfast. That brings me to my first huge complaint. It wasn't exactly coffee that they had--it was one of those little multi-beverage machines that produced a hot brownish coffee-flavored beverage. I think it's actually supposed to be \"brewed\" but I think they just run some hot water over some instant flake things. Think sanka. Instant coffee would have been preferable. Let me just add that I understand Red Roof Inn is not a fancy hotel and I wasn't expecting Starbucks, just a cup of real coffee. It's not that difficult or expensive to run a coffee maker. And if they don't want to do that, they shouldn't claim to provide it. Okay, I'm obsessing, but I'll bet I'm not the only one who wants a dang cup of coffee in the mornings. Our plan was to purchase a roll or something simple we could heat up for a light breakfast and grab a cup of coffee from the lobby. Well, on to plan B and that meant buying breakfast out. We dealt with it but.... Okay, enough whining over that. My second complaint was that everything seemed to be done on the absolute cheapest-of-the-cheap. We got a tiny little bar of soap for the shower and they have gone to the little single-use shampoo packets instead of the traditional small bottles. Okay, lots of inexpensive places have done that. But it would have been nice to have 2 packets--one for each of us. Cheap. There was only one small trash can for the entire room--none in the bathroom area at all which was inconvenient. And when we had to get an address and directions over the phone and there was no pen or paper in the room. We had a pen but had to scrounge for something to write on. Most inexpensive places still give you a few little sheets of paper. We didn't need fancy stationery and weren't paying for that, but c'mon. There's no frills but this was just plain cheap. Okay, that's the complaints. Nothing we couldn't live with. Otherwise the place was actually very good. The woman who checked up in was very friendly and made us feel welcome. And the clerk when we left was very helpful getting me info to get to the car rental at the airport. The room was cleaner than most and beds were firm and comfortable. Even the air conditioning was good; quiet, easy to adjust and didn't get overly cold or warm which was a pleasant surprise. So except for the few annoyances it's a good place to stay. Just be prepared to provide everything for yourself (including a trash bag) and it's just fine. I might stay there again, depending on the circumstances, but there are other inexpensive choices nearby and I'd probably try one of those instead.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":4,"Value":2,"Rooms":2,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-08-23 11:01:35 +0300","author":"Valentine Gleason"},{"content":"We stayed at RR North on April 11 for 2 nights, I have stayed in other RR hotels in other states but this time I think it was a room that it was not bad so but nice is not also the adjetive to describe it, clean?

I stayed a week and I must say this place is such a great place to stay. Room and bathroom were small but that's ok. There was a TV with 2 english channels on it, the beds were nice, and the place as a whole made up for it greatly. There was excellent service at the front desk and they made it so easy for me with the english they spoke very well. Shuttle was always on time and the maid tidied up the room every day. Bellman will push the elevator button for you and direct you out to the shuttle bus when it arrived. If I had any shopping, direction, or nightlife question they were always helpful by pulling out a map and pointing out all they knew (which was alot).They called taxis for me (one time the guest service guy went all the way up the road just to flag one down for me)! I was so very pleased with my stay and would stay there over and over again. Be careful, though, It's in Olympic City which is not an area where many other westerners stay. The place is still VERY safe, and was never in any worry that anything would be stolen. I was pretty much the only westerner at the hotel. But a 5 min. shuttle ride will get you to an MTR metro station which will open the doors to anywhere you want to go in Kowloon or Hong Kong Island. It's SUPER cheap! So are the taxis, but more expensive than the MTR.On the food end, there is a McDonalds just down the road, but who wants to go there? When you're in HK, do as the HKese do and eat at a local restaurant. There is a place very close by, to the left of the 7eleven I always called the Hot Pot place because it's real name was written in chinese, but it had THE best food from Vietnames, Chinese, and Indian you could get it there. Plus the bakery shops are also another thing to die for. I kept getting the raisin bread twists that were always sold there.Nightlife...not in Olympic City or the surrounding area. Take the MTR to TST (in Kowloon) or Central station (on HK island) and enjoy the nightlife there, it'll only cost you about $2 US to get you there and it's quick. Only trouble I had here was getting back. The MTR closes at 12:30am and to get back after that time you had to take a taxi. I was either in TST or on HK Island so to get back to my hotel it usually ran me between $4.50 US and $15 US depending on just how far away I was from my hotel.I would definitely stay here again without a hesitation.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Business service":3,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2012-09-05 09:02:12 +0300","author":"Wilma Thompson"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lon":-122.4265,"lat":37.7872},"free_breakfast":true,"email":"stay@queenanne.com","phone":"+1 415 441-2828","vacancy":false,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":"1590 Sutter Street","description":"The Queen Anne provides a real San Francisco experience, being an 1890 Victorian Hotel between Pacific Heights and the Civic Center, and near Japantown.

Décor is reminiscent of a western theme with knotty pine furniture and kitchen flooring. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Conveniently located with shopping nearby including a Fry’s grocery (part of the Kroger family). I’m used to Kroger in Atlanta, and was pleasantly surprised that when I punched in my phone number it recognized my Kroger/Fry’s member card and saved me several dollars on my purchases. The in-suite full kitchen is a must for hotels these days IMHO, and I usually select Homewood Suites or Residence Inns for that reason. Nice light suppers provided at their “Welcome Home Reception” Monday through Thursday. Chicken fajitas with rice, refried beans and green salad were on the menu for Monday night. I was a bit surprised that beer and wine were not offered as at other locations I have been to in Las Vegas, Dallas, and Orlando, but I ended up eating there the rest of my Monday thru Friday stay for the convenience after working long days, even though I could have expensed meals elsewhere to my company. Menu items the rest of the week included meat loaf and mashed potatoes, marinara sauce and meatballs, and always included a salad bar. The evening suppers at Homewood are certainly several notches above the snack-type evening offerings at any Residence Inn where I’ve stayed. Wonderful daily breakfasts are also a plus, with rotating menu items including bacon, scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, waffles, cold and hot cereal, fruits, yogurt, and a variety of beverages. I purposely chose a suite opposite the sports bar that another reviewer mentioned as being rather noisy using the online advance check-in system through the Hilton web site. I heard absolutely no noise from it, but I was only there Monday thru Friday, so they probably only really crank it up on weekends. Very friendly staff…every staff member said hello when passing them in the halls.

Only a few minutes from downtown and the airport, and easy access to most major thru ways (51, I-10, 101, 202, I-17). On my first stay they told me they only had one room left, a queen smoking. I asked to be moved at the first available opening, don't think they even tried. The coworker whom I was commuting with, who already had a room here had checked in a week earlier and they told him all they had was smoking then too. Those beds were not queen but double and the smell of smoke was almost intollerable. I had to keep my windows open constantly and even used a whole bottle of odor nutralizing spray. On my next stay (4 days between stays) I was given a king non-smoking, MUCH BETTER. [I do have to say that the suite with 2 dbls was more spacious than the king] I really enjoyed the evening receptions 4 days a week. However they would only put out a few things at a time and it would run out quickly and they were not being replaced quickly enough. The food area did not have good flow and would quickly get cluttered with people.

Hidden downtown within easy walk of Staples Center and theaters, this understated hotel is fantastic. Huge rooms and suites, full access to the sporting facilities, and free breakfast (unusual in US) and internet. The Athletic club itself is a huge fitness facility with everything you could ask for x 10, The locker room attendant seemed a little daunting at first but turned out to be super helpful, as we're the front desk staff at all times. There is no valet parking, but there is a covered multistorey car park next door with easy access to the hotel, and it's cheap with validation. The only downside of this stay was the closure of the swimming pool for maintenance and renovation without any notice to either my travel agent or myself when I booked. It had been a major reason for the stay, (along with the location near The Orpheum Theater) so that was disappointing. However pool overhaul should be completed by now and it is huge. Everything else was so good this aberration was soon overlooked and forgiven. Not the glamour of Hollywood, and a little rough on the streets after dark, but none of this matters if you need a discreet bolt hole downtown. Great bar half a block west too, Seven Grand.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2012-01-01 22:29:56 +0300","author":"Fernando Turner"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lon":-118.4945,"lat":34.01155},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1 310 451-0676","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":"$180-280","address":"120 Colorado Ave","description":"Hotel is quaint, comfortable and some rooms have a partial ocean view."}

The hotel serves a good (and free) breakfast, and the bar on the third floor is very cool and hosts happy hour. My friends and I took one of our drinks to the rooftop where we had an amazing view of downtown. I did love the hair and shampoo products, but my one complaint would be the towels; they weren't very fluffy/soft but instead more on the scratchy side.

We were not disappointed and were very impressed with the choice. The service provided by the front desk was warm and felt like they genuinely cared instead of a man/woman in a sharp suit but with an arrogant and blase attitude. The front desk were helpful in providing directions and both check in and check out was efficient. I might just add that we were also upgraded to a king size bed for no cost or apparent reason at check in other than the fact that we got off a 15 hour flight and looked probably like we had no sleep. A plate of welcome fruit was also provided. In terms of the room, if you are a fan of the more classical looking decors, this one would suit you fine. The photos on websites/trip advisor does it total justice. The complimentary gym is great and as good as any commercial gym (well it is a commercial gym) and the complimentary breakfast was good enough given it was free. Also, free Wall street Journal for those who care. Only con's - could provide more toiletries as we were running low but they weren't replaced. For those who are particular - the bathroom does show a few signs of aging but more than usable for my standards. Overall, this hotel felt like it wasn't big enough to be arrogant and cared about its customers, provided the amenities we needed, great service, great price, great location if downtown is where you want to be and one of the few hotels that i have visited globally that I'd say had true historical character.

THERE WAS NO COFFEE AVAILABLE FROM ANY SOURCE OTHER THAN THE 7-11 ACROSS THE STREET BEFORE BREAKFAST WAS SERVED (no room service, no coffee pot in lobby, no coffee maker in room). WHO WANTS TO GET DRESSED AND CROSS THE STREET IN DOWNTOWN LA JUST TO GET A CUP OF COFFEE?

Most of its 12 story Downtown LA building is taken up with seem to (non-athlete) me to be topflight athletic facilities. There's what I'm pretty sure is a full length, multi-lane swimming pool with a kiddie pool next to it. There's a basketball court that might be full length too. There are exercise machines, a sauna, even a billiard room. The hotel rooms only take up the top 3 floors and there didn't seem to be a whole lot of people staying there one Friday night. I thought they might be there more as a convenience for club members and their families than as a full-fledged hotel. The floor by floor dress code (I kid you not) explained on a paper in my room might fit that image. The rooms are extremely dowdy. The place's elegance has a faded a bit too much, at least in the guest rooms. They're so dowdy that the club plans to renovate them this summer into a richer, retro, yes clubby look. They had photosimulations of the rooms posted on the floor where I stayed. It might have been nice if they'd told us this on the website. For now, the rooms are just tired, the chairs, all the furnishings, the bed lines are all faded. There aren't enough light fixtures in the room, though mine got some eastern natural light, amidst the buildings of Downtown Los Angeles (I liked that part). The carpet was really stained all over the place, not something I normally notice. I don't think there was true dirt around and nothing bit me, but it did add up to a depressing feeling. I'd note parenthetically that I tend to discount complaints on Tripadvisor that something is, horrors, old. Some people seem offended that buildings--like, say, the Waldorf-Astoria--were built more than 10 years ago. But the LA Athletic Club is old in the bad sense. After the renovation it could be much better. I didn't feel a lot of warmth from the people working there. Most were OK, but at least one seemed to be mocking me, not a feeling I usually get in a hotel. Maybe by wearing a daypack backpack I was violating the dress code! It really didn't work well when I tried to check in (at normal time, with a reservation) and the front desk clerk called and called housekeeping to find an available room. Positives: Well located within Downtown LA, close to most Downtown locations and plenty of transit including numerous bus lines and Metrorail lines. They included a free, large, if mediocre breakfast in one of the many dining rooms. City views of a historic part of Downtown LA. A roof deck with nothing but some chairs on it, but even better city views. All those athletic facilities, which might be good with a kid.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":3,"Value":4,"Rooms":3,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":3},"date":"2013-02-17 17:42:35 +0300","author":"Keyshawn Schuster"},{"content":"This was out first hotel for our holiday - The location was very good as it was not too far from the airport and very close to a large shopping complex and bus routes and some attractions.

She then asks me to mail her or fax her my receipt when I got home as she did not have a copy of it. (WHAT? no reciept copy which I signed???) We hang up, she then calls me back (as I am driving) and then tells me she made a mistake and apologizes.

No in-room TV (a good thing), computer, or shampoo; older bathroom and room, but kept clean by very friendly and efficient housekeeping staff.

There is a microwave, fridge and free coffee and tea at the hotel for guest use. So if you don't mind a simple, old but relatively clean place with characters and be aware of a few things, you will be fine in a most welcoming place ran by friendly staff: Scott and Leon.

Much to our surprise, the hotel restaurant bar and eating area was packed, and not by convention visitors staying at the hotel I might add. Indeed, we learned that the restaurant is frequented by locals and based on our experience, I can see why. The food quality was exceptional as was the service. I especially liked the healthy choices on the menu. Our room was also terrific. Clean, incredibly quiet which is amazing considering the the hotel is located on a strip between two LAX runways, and very comfortable. We loved watching planes land one after another from our hotel window. We arrived following an international flight and didn't have a dime of American currency to tip the bell staff. Still, they could not have been more gracious. The service was of such a high quality that we made an effort to find an ATM so we could tip accordingly before departing. This is a place where service with a smile still means something. Everything worked like clockwork, from the high quality restaurant meal to the efficient check in.

After calling, we were then told that there were no rooms with a King or Queen-sized bed available due to a pipe-bursting problem. If the check-in staff had been more professional, we should have been notified of the hotel's problem and given options right away instead of having to discover it for ourselves. 3) One phone was broken, and Line 1 on the other phone was broken.

The room did not look well-kept. 4) Upon our request, we finally were moved to a different room with a double bed that looked more decent, although there was a seemingly open and used soap at the sink and the phone handset was not working the next morning.

I recently went up for a one-night trip with my children over the Christmas holiday to do some sight-seeing in L.A. We found a good rate on Hotwire ($78 plus tax was around $96 total). Parking (with in-and-out privileges) is $22.50/day. The first room we went into was filled with smoke, so we trekked back downstairs and were put in a room on one of the \"Starwood Preferred Guest\" floors, which didn't seem to be any different from the others. The clerk was very friendly and apologetic and I would say the service was good at the front desk. At another time, when I had lost my parking pass and needed a new one, the clerk was very helpful and then took a look at my kids and came back with two Westin Adventure Kids backpacks plus goodies inside. I felt they were trying to make our stay nice. The downside is that, while the hotel is close to LAX, it's in the neighborhood close to LAX. It's not someplace you'd want to walk around outside. Walking out front would be like walking on the side of a freeway. Also, the housekeeping was pretty poor. Our room had a noticeable layer of dust along the entire desk/dresser/minibar area and the bathrooms were very average, especially for something rated as a four-star hotel in Hotwire. The beds were comfortable, like other Westin beds, and the room was fairly quiet, but that may have been different if the hotel were more full. The hotel has a heated pool on the third floor. It's an average-sized pool and the water temperature is heated but not terribly warm. We went in in the evening, when it was in the 50s outside, and the pool felt pretty cool. The jacuzzi was much better, though you can't sit in the jacuzzi and watch your kids in the pool because there are steps and a wall between the two. So if your kids want to swim, be prepared to stay by the pool and save the jacuzzi time for later. The gym is currently being remodeled (as of December 2011). I didn't check out the temporary gym that they had in place. As far as location is concerned, as I mentioned it is minutes from LAX on Century Blvd. We used the hotel as a home base to do activities in Santa Monica. With L.A. traffic going either on the 405 or up the Pacific Coast Highway, it's about 30 minutes to Santa Monica. Having said all of this, my kids thought this was a WONDERFUL hotel. They say it's definitely a four-star hotel and one of the nicest they've been in. Don't they remember the stay at the Hyatt Regency in Maui? So, evidently, it made a great impression on them and hopefully that accounts for something. My tip would be to check Hotwire and try to get a good rate. At less that $100 a night, you'll feel it's a good value.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":4,"Value":4,"Rooms":3,"Location":3,"Cleanliness":2,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2015-10-13 21:24:50 +0300","author":"Zola Berge"},{"content":"Very nice and well located hotel at less than 2 miles from LAX.

Sadly, it has suffered a steep decline in customer service. I would not recommend this hotel for people wanting uninterrupted sleep, or for visitors to LA looking for humane treatment after a long flight. Stay somewhere else. Starwood Preferred? I wouldn't recommend it for you, dear member, either. I arrived at midnight, tired, after a long-delayed flight. As a member, I automatically just lined up in that line, only to be completely ignored by the desk clerk. The desk clerk kept taking guests from the other line, presumably because the \"Preferred\" clerk was off having a tea-break. Eventually, the Preferred clerk arrived back, and motioned me forward. No \"hello\", no \"nice to see you, just a bored, unfriendly \"name?\". Then he couldn't find my reservation. He sighed, went and got the night manager, and both of them stood there for the next several minutes slowly scrolling their way through the system - at midnight. Hello... person needing to sleep here... Eventually they found half of my booking, but had trouble reconciling the two nights, presumably because they were prepaid using points. After a dozen more minutes they got that sorted out - then put me in a room with two single beds. So we started over. After a half hour more delay, they finally sent me to an incredibly noisy room that faced the runway - exactly the type of room I had requested that they not put me in. By then, even I was too tired to care, so I turned in. Then around one a.m., a party started in the room next door (warning to guests: the Westin has very thin walls). I called down but no one called or came up or did anything to stop the noise, so after fifteen minutes, I knocked on the door myself and the guests were kind enough to stop. Roll on to this morning - despite my placing a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door, a Westin day manager with a clipboard knocked on my door and woke me up to tell me that it was \"time for me to check out.\" I told him I was booked for two nights and was desperately trying to get some sleep. Sorry, but you need to check out, he said. No, I don't, I replied. Please check. After a little more prodding, he checked. Oh, you're right. He then apologized (the only manager that apologized for anything during this entire stay) - but by that time I was awake. Roll on to the evening. I'm dead tired by now and have just fallen asleep when the Duty Manager (a man who would perhaps be better suited to working at a morgue than in live customer service) wakes me up to tell me that my credit card has been declined and he needs another card. I told him that is not possible because it is a Gold Amex, and completely up to date, and asked him to retry it, but he refused to. So I offered to give him another card over the phone. He said no, you can't do this over the phone, we need to have the physical card to swipe. I said, look, the rooms are prepaid, the card you have is fine, I'm sleeping, if you need another card for the incidentals, I'll give it to you in the morning. He gets testy and responds by saying if you don't provide me with the card, you can't continue to stay in the hotel. Say what? I remind him that I've prepaid for my two nights (the card is being used for incidentals only.) He says it doesn't matter - he needs to swipe the card, or I can't stay - even though I've pre-paid for the room! At this point, I'm getting annoyed. I've paid for the room with points earned from hundreds of stays at Starwood properties. And this is the third time I've been deprived of sleep in less than 24 hours at the Westin LAX, and I'm exhausted. I call Amex. They confirm my card is 100% fine - the hotel made an error while entering the credit card date - they entered 11 instead of 14. I ask them to hold, get dressed, go down to the lobby and ask for the manager. I put him on the phone with Amex. Amex confirms to him that the hotel made a mistake. The rooms are fully paid for (and had been all along). The incidentals will be covered, if he just enters the date correctly. We hang up. I ask the manager for an apology. He refuses. He says instead that if I don't like the service, I can leave. At this point, I'm stunned. And beyond tired, and really frustrated. I can't believe the level of tone-deafness on display. The guy shows no understanding of the concept that the primary reason that anyone needs a hotel room is because they want to sleep. I don't know who to feel more sorry for - myself, future weary travelers, or Starwood shareholders. Anyway, sorry for the long rant, but that's what these reviews are for - sharing. Speaking of which, I am now writing this from the Hilton LAX, where the people were nice on check in and treated me like a fellow human being (thank you!) I'd forgotten how nice the Hilton LAX is. Now that I'm back, I would strongly suggest that visitors to the LA Airport area stay here instead of the Westin - it's usually around the same price, but closer to the airport, the amenities are similar, the food is better, but most importantly, it appears to be staffed by caring humans. As for the Westin LAX, unless you enjoy being treated like the meat in a sausage machine by uncaring duty managers, and constantly deprived of sleep, you may want to avoid it. Life's too short, and \"Preferred\" clearly isn't what it used to be.","ratings":{"Overall":1,"Service":1,"Value":1,"Rooms":3,"Location":3,"Cleanliness":3,"Sleep Quality":1},"date":"2015-11-10 14:12:55 +0300","author":"Joan Oberbrunner"},{"content":"Stayed here twice this week, had stayed here several times before.

Neutral tones and unfussy decor. We are fussy about our lodgings and we really could not complain about this hotel. The red trolley bus that takes you to Manhattan Beach and some shopping precincts is just across the road and only costs $5 per ticket which you can purchase on bus. Airport shuttles come every 15-20 mins and are free.

The check-in process was easy and the staff was more than eager to help with all of our luggage and getting us into our room. The room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. This was my first time to travel out to LA with my young children and the staff at the Westin Hotel did a great job making my boys feel welcomed. Since I was traveling with two young boys, I thought it would be great to have a view of the planes taking off and landing outside of the hotel window. I specifically requested a high floor with a view of the airport and that is what I received. I will say that being so close to the airport and in line with the flight path, one would think that the jet engine noise would prevent a great night's rest, well I was wrong. The rooms are insulated very well from the noise, so you would see planes landing, but you could barely hear them, which was great for my wife and I. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.

You can stay here on a very cheap SPG points rate - just need 3K points. As all my business expenses are coming out of my own pocket, I have to sometimes stay on points and this is the perfect place to spend them. Other than that it is a consistent mid-range hotel geared towards business traveler and airline crews. The only inconsistent thing is parking charges - I still cannot figure out why sometimes they charge for parking and sometimes not. Some of the rooms can be noisy due to airport proximity, but overall sound isolation is quite good. If you have SPG status, there is an executive lounge that even serves some kind of breakfast, but I was leaving early so cannot comment on the quality or quantity.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":4,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":3},"date":"2012-06-28 13:28:46 +0300","author":"Anabelle Harvey"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-118.50113,"lat":34.01871},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1 310-394-5454","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":"1111 Second St","description":"A luxury hotel featuring a business center, fitness facilities, concierge service, and fine dining at The Penthouse."}

We are Starwood Preferred Guest Gold - Elite level 3. I would compare this hotel to a cheap two star property. We were supposedly upgraded to a \"deluxe\" room - if this was \"deluxe\" I wonder what the regular rooms are. Despite our status as SPG, no amenities were offered - no internet, no concierge. The room was small. A localized heater - no thermostat on the wall. The bathroom was equipped with typical soap, and shampoo, but the towels were small, and certainly not up to typical Westin standard (although they were Westin label). No glassware in the room - only plastic cups as are found in much cheaper motels. The \"mini-bar\" consisted of a small tray on the dresser and about 6 or 8 snack items. Other than the heavenly bed that is offered in Westin brand, I would compare this to a low end two star. We picked this hotel based on the Westin reputation, and were greatly disappointed. When we checked out we expressed our disappointment and noted that the Starwood points were not included (this was corrected).

We didn't eat on the property, but there was a Subway a very short walk away where we had a meal. Thrifty Car Rental was an even shorter walk away (across the street), where we rented a vehicle for the day to see some of the sights in L.A.. I made use of the fitness facility on the morning and there were no issues at all to speak of. It wasn't large, but had everything I needed.

Even though we booked the rooms via Priceline, the staff provided excellent services. We got a room on the 20th floor with beautiful views of the city and the water (maybe because we were their Gold member). The bed was so soft and huge for two people. The location is convenient within walking distance to everything: Chinatown (2 blocks), subway (red line is right around the corner), movie theaters (couple of blocks), opera house (just across the street), Boston Common, Fenuil Hall, Quincy market, shopping centers, North Street to the Old North Church and little Italy. By the way, if you like Italian food, try Antico Forno (93 Salem St, North End). The food was absolutely delicious, and the price was very reasonable. The only thing we didn't like about Boston is that the parking fee was outrageous ($26/night for self parking underneath the hotel). Use this one. Don't use the one across the street. It is not cheaper ($25/night). Be aware of the parking attentant at this parking lot. We used them the first night. The guy said that it would be $22/night for overnight parking. But when we went the next morning to get our car, the attendant demanded $25. We disagreed and paid $22. He didn't like it, but let us go. They changed their price on the board the next day. We parked our car in the garage underneath the hotel for the rest of our stay. No trouble after that. Overall, we highly recommend this hotel to everybody.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2012-08-10 04:42:12 +0300","author":"Patrick Kertzmann"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lon":-118.38407,"lat":34.056531},"free_breakfast":false,"email":null,"phone":"+1-310-275-4445","vacancy":false,"free_parking":true,"price":null,"address":"1119 South Robertson Blvd","description":"Suite accommodations."}

The main reason for staying here was to get free access to the tower so we could go up in the day and at night. I stayed here previously in 2004, but it does seem to have gone downhill a bit. The staff were great, but it definitely seemed to be a budget bus tour hotel. It is a bit out of the way of the main strip, with a number of unfinished hotel/casino's inbetween. We stayed in a Stratosphere Select room which was recently refurbished very tastefully and to a high quality. There are limited restaurant choices - a 50's style diner that served mostly burger type food, and an italian that was fairly expensive. There are plenty of fast food outlets, so first night we grabbed a pizza and ate in our room, and the second we got a taxi down to the main lively area of the strip ($15). The room prices make the place attractive, but we'd recommend paying a few dollars more and staying further down the strip (i.e. Mandalay Bay to Treasure Island area).","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":4,"Value":3,"Rooms":5,"Location":2,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2012-10-26 20:10:43 +0300","author":"Estevan Oga"},{"content":"Awesome hotel for the price!

Was very, very pleased with the experience at the Stratosphere. Got one of the recently renovated rooms on an upper floor, and it was awesome - it actually looked just like the pictures posted on their site. Room was clean, functional, nicely decorated, and aired out. The bed was fantastic - big cushy new mattress with high quality bedding and lots of pillows. And maybe I just got lucky, but the hotel seemed quiet for all four nights I was there - no amatuer young drinkers stumbling and \"woo-ing\" up and down the halls, and no objectionable noise to speak of from the street. Elevators were fast and kept spotless. The casino was a lot of fun, and seemed to have a wide variety of patrons (everything from Jersey Shore candidates to Midwestern types). I wouldn't say the slots were loose per se, but the money seemed to last a bit longer here than on other places on the Strip. Drink service was good - the drinks were weak as water, but they kept them coming quickly and were very friendly. Actually, all the staff I encountered, from the cleaning crew to the conscierge, were very friendly and efficient. And while I think the $8 per night or whatever they charge for a \"resort fee\" is lame, it does include unlimited passes to the tower observation deck, which provides a surreal view, night or day. As for the location... yes, it is kind of isolated. But if you plan well and are prepared to shell out a bit for the bus, monorail, or taxi, you'll be fine. It's probably too far to walk to the \"good\" stuff on the Strip, and I wouldn't advise walking to downtown under any circumstances, unless you're with a large posse of sober ninjas that could take on all the toothless and tweaking street people swarming that particular stretch. The Strat is somewhat of a self-contained city, anyway (with tons of onsite shops and conveniences), and you can probably take care of the majority of your wants and needs within the confines of the property. Roxy's Diner had great food, and the little Mexican place upstairs was pretty good, too. There's also a McDonald's and Starbucks onsite if you just need something fast. I can honestly only find one fault with the Stratosphere, and that's the bar soap they provide. The lotion, shampoo, shower gel and conditioner are fine, but that bar soap was useless and vile. Seriously - that's my only gripe about the place. Will absoutely be back to stay and play here. I hope everyone else has the same good experience.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":3,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2014-10-22 01:56:14 +0300","author":"Jadyn Ankunding"},{"content":"As you walk into the hotel, you will smell stale tobacco smoke and the smoke will follow you during our entire visit.

I went with three other women, two came down with bronchitis due to heavy smoke exposure (they are none smokers). Absolutely no ventilation. The hotel is not near the action, too far off the strip to enjoy the Vegas experience. If you leave the hotel, you must take a cab or walk through a rough area of town. One can walking to the Monorail a few blocks away -so that is an option. Do not take the bus!! The buses fill up quickly, the drivers are rude and you must have the exact change to board or buy a ticket. Plus, the bus will $@!#% part of your day, getting to your location. Claustrophobia doesn't begin to express the bus ride, its also dirty. There is not a microwave or coffee pot in the room. Actually, I did not find the hotel had anything to offer that I couldn't find at a hotel at the strip.

They ended up moving us the next day and this room was SO much better, I can't believe the two rooms were in the same hotel. The trip went smoothly until we received our bill the last morning. We had been charged for 2 movies we hadn't ordered, and were charged $2.00 to call the front desk the first night. The man at the front desk was very nice and removed all the charges. I wouldn't stay here again. I recommend it to people who maybe have a long layover, as long as you can get into a room on the 10th floor or above. The first room was dirty, the waiters at the restaurant were rude, they charge you $22 a day for parking, and it's not in a very convenient location for anything but the airport.

She had never been and we knew she would love it. I actually went on a hotel discount site and was given this hotel. I had been in the Portland location once and remember it being beautiful and have stayed at other Kimpton hotels and had great experiences. After receiving notice of our reservation I emailed their staff and informed them this trip was for a birthday and requested a room with 2 beds, hopefully towards the top. The assistant manager promptly replied and said that he could accommodate that request but the 2-bed options were lower and didn't have the best views. He then offered to upgrade us for $40 to one of the suites on the top floor. Given that we got such a good deal on the hotel price it was a no-brainer. The suite was excellent with a king bed in the bedroom and a pullout queen sleeper sofa in the living area. Both rooms had their own TV's and there was a curtain that could be drawn to separate the two areas. The room was very clean and well appointed. The bathroom was nice but wasn't as lavish as some other 4-star hotels we've been to. All of the soaps and shampoos though were high-end and there was nothing lacking. That night the hotel staff also left a note in our room with a birthday card for our daughter which included a free in-room movie rental as well as an invitation to call down for a complimentary birthday cake. We called down and they brought up a delicious personal-sized chocolate cake with ice cream and a candle in it. She was very excited! Throughout our 2-night stay the staff continued to be amazing. We spent a lot of our time checking out Seattle attractions but each time we came back we were greeted warmly. There was a wine tasting each night in the lobby and the staff always offered to get my daughter a soft drink from the restaurant. There were bowls of chocolates around that we all enjoyed as well. If I had anything to add to the \"con\" side it would be that the views from this hotel aren't as attractive as some others I've stayed at in Seattle. It's only an 11-story building and there are taller buildings surrounding it. If you're expecting a full city view or one of the water you may be disappointed. We also thought the cost of valet parking was a little much, coming to nearly $40 per night with taxes. I am sure this is on-par with other 4-star hotels but is pretty hard to justify. We opted to valet on Friday night but found street parking on Saturday night since parking is free on Sundays. Overall though, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend staying there. Even with getting our reservation through a third party site we were never treated differently and that says a lot about a place.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-06-22 15:13:16 +0300","author":"Mr. Al Simonis"},{"content":"My wife and I decided to visit Seattle for a quick weekend trip to get away for our 20th anniversary.

The hotel is in the perfect spot in Seattle because you can walk to Pikeâ€™s Market, the movies, the shopping center and even the tram to get you around town. The hotelâ€™s wine reception was great and we found others had brought their pets with them. Kimptonâ€™s â€œpet friendlyâ€� program is wonderful.

The bellman was busy with another car when we arrived, but noticed the car in front right away and within a very short period met up with me at the reception desk to get the key from me. We stayed in one of the Monte Carlo suites -- great energizing decor. Comfortable living room area, seperated from bedroom by large drapes, which was great for reading the morning papers or sipping the wine from the lobby before heading out to dinner. The bath had plenty of counter space for both of us (though one sink). The bed was comfortable with a range of pillows, as well as seating arrangements including a nice, comfortable chair and a small, two person bench seat for shoes, dressing, etc. Our maid service did a great job with meticulous neatening up. We also had dinner one night in Sazarac, a New Orleans style restaurant where we encountered more of the same: normal people, working hard, to provide thoughtful, positive service. This included our host, who conscientiously got us a table and our waitress who was busy, friendly, informative and attentive.

We met some friends of ours, who also stayed there in a separate room. The location was good for us and anyone who doesn't have issues with moderate walking -- it was a multi-block walk to Pikes Market, the waterfront, etc. -- you do have up hill walking when you return to the hotel from Pikes Market or the waterfront, though we found some streets to be less steep than others (Union Street, for instance). From the moment we arrived at the hotel we found the staff to be friendly, professional and helpful, and this continued throughout our stay -- the valet, doorman, front desk reps, concierge, housekeeping, etc. Each time we were leaving the hotel, the front desk people would acknowledge us with pleasantries such as \"have a nice day\"; upon our return they would again acknowledge us with \"welcome back\", or something similar. The evening wine event in the lobby was a very nice touch. The overall feel of the hotel was that it was nicely decorated and clean and felt welcoming. The room was also nicely decorated and clean and larger than the average hotel room. There was ample comfortable seating, i.e. two upholstered chairs and a very comfortable desk chair at the large desk. Also, the room had multiple sources of bright lighting -- best lighting of any hotel we've stayed in. There was a nice size flat screen TV, stocked mini-fridge (items for purchase), stocked snack tray (also for purchase), and a room safe as well. Though coffee service is provided in the lobby each morning, there is no coffee service in the room, however, you can request a set-up for your room, if desired. The beds were extremely comfortable, i.e. the mattress, linens, comforter, and pillows. The air conditioner worked great and you are able to control the temp. to your liking from the in-room thermostat. The bathroom, too, was larger than usual. The shower head was to die for and with great water pressure, so you didn't have to spend a longer-than-usual amount of time in the shower trying to shower with a trickle of water, as is the case in many hotels (especially important to those of us with longer, thicker hair). They also had a wall-mounted rack containing full-size pump bottles of shampoo, cream rinse, and liquid bath soap. A hair dryer was also provided. You should know ahead of time, as we did, that many of the rooms face directly towards another high rise, in close proximity, especially if you want a room with two beds versus a king; we were told that there are no two bed rooms not facing the building; besides not having a view or much natural light, this necessitates keeping your curtains closed for privacy -- but, again, at least there's great lighting provided in the room. There are only two things I would add to my wish list for the hotel -- one is to have at least some two-bed rooms that don't face a building and the second is to provide larger than the standard size bath towels. All in all, this was a terrific hotel experience and we will definitely return there on future trips.

We had a basic room with a kingsize bed, and felt the room was sizeable. Loved the crazy print robes! They were a nice touch. Did not adopt a goldfish for our stay, but had a chance to visit with some in the hallway and lobby. Another nice, quirky touch that makes you remember this place. The bedding was some of the most comfortable that we have had. We also enjoyed the wine hour in the lobby, where we got a chance to meet some other people and share travel stories. Aside from a lackluster breakfast at Sazerac where our waiter was one of the worst we have ever had, we would highly recommend this place to travellers.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":4,"Value":4,"Rooms":5,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2013-02-22 08:11:09 +0300","author":"Joseph Hackett PhD"},{"content":"I arrived after nightfall and was greeted by a spectacular view of the Space Needle.

Initially I was put in a room on the Virginia Street side where there is a huge apartment building going up. The first night I was woken up at 6:45 AM due to extremely loud construction drilling, banging, trucks driving, & men at work. I asked to have my room changed immediately & the staff was accommodating. I was moved to the 4th Avenue side of the hotel & able to sleep undisturbed. The hotel location is great. The rooms were fine, but I would say that the lights were very dim. Brighter lighting would be helpful. I second some of the comments here about the mildew in bathrooms & small size of the bathrooms. However, the closets were quite large. The hotel gym was quite small & had only 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical machine & 1 stairmaster. The business center was also small-with only 2 computers, but free internet access & printing. The lobby is nice with the fireplace & Scandinavian decor.

I prefer something that offers a distinct personality but also a calming sense of familiarity. That said, I hereby declare that the Hotel Andra in Seattle is the Tina Fey of the hospitality industry - alluring and cool and quirky and fun, all rolled into one. It's a rare find that offers exceptional design, ample space, distinct character, and stellar customer service. I came across the Andra via my secret weapon, aka my friend Steve who just happens to work for the Seattle Convention and Visitor's Bureau. With a prime location in the heart of Seattle's Belltown area and moderate price range (under $200/night), I knew we were off to a good start, and after poking around their website, the vibe and decor seemed like the right match too. I was instantly drawn in by the sleek lighting, clean lines, and tasteful color palette of muted blues, greys, and taupes, with touches of Scandanvian inspiration. The Andra was our last stop during our recent honeymoon vacation, and prior to checking in, I had just made my detour to Cupcake Royale. So as I approached the reception desk with a box of treats in hand, in lieu of the standard welcome, the person behind the counter launched into a bit about how nice it was for me to bring him cupcakes. I played right along - I love it when people loosen up and goof around like that, especially people who work in the higher end of the hospitality world, where more often than not you'll encounter some pretty stiff attitudes. The front desk staff seemed to think they were in a improv group, with me as their special guest star, so score one for the Andra. Score two was finding out upon check in that we'd been upgraded to a suite (thanks to the little Upgrade Fairy, also known as my friend Steve who had put in a call to the manager). Also, the timing couldn't have been better in terms of being granted additional space - we'd accumulated a lot of goodies over the past week, and found ourselves in a serious repacking situation, which meant needing some room to spread out. Wish granted: a corner suite with a spacious living room area that included a flatscreen TV, giant desk, and full length mirror, along with another flatscreen TV in the separate bedroom. The bathroom was also really cute and stylish, and the stash of Face Stockholm products made me a very happy girl. The Andra proved to be the perfect end to our trip - so if you're headed to Seattle, this is the place to stay.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2013-04-13 10:05:24 +0300","author":"Constance Koss"},{"content":"The hotel looked disappointingly ordinary from the outside, but once you get into the small lobby area, the atmosphere is stylish and cheerful.

My only criticism was the room service from the Lola restaurant. Not only did they deliver the wrong order, but it was over-salted and over-priced.

There are awesome restuarants right nearby in the up and coming, funky neighborhood of Belletown, like - FlyingFish (HIGHY recommend), Toi, great Thai, Mama Mexico, Assagio (next to the hotel). I absolutely LOVED Seattle, loved the location of this hotel and would absolutely stay there again. The beds were the most comfortable and luxurious I have slept on outside of the W.

Unlike some of the other reviews for this hotel, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful (maybe the Management responded to the negative feedback). My only complaints were: the street noise during weekday commute hours (windows need better insulation) and both of our room keys kept demagnetizing. Otherwise, the Suite was very spacious and comfortable. In fact, I have never slept in a more comfortable and cozy bed. Bathroom is small, but cute and Art Deco-like. The decor in general is very new and Ikea inspired. Valet parking was quick, efficient and friendly (always asked if we needed directions).

There are only a few little flaws in the hotel that deducted a few points. Stayed in Seattle the first weekend in November and chose The Edgewater due to its proximics to most of the major attractions in the city. We were without a car and are walkers so this was a plus. If you are not the hotel offers a free shuttle that runs every hour and will take you anywhere withing two miles. We only took the shuttle once and realized they don't pick you up (not a problem in our case) but...if they do they never mentioned it!! The hotel is older and at first glance may not be up to everyones perfection but it is well kept and does actually sit out over the water. It's next to the cruise line building, near the Aquarium, the wharf, and ferry buildings. Not to mention Pike Market and some amazing restaurants. The hotel offers wonderful views from the sitting area which comes complete with fireplace and from the lounge as well. Our room was a water front room and the views were wonderful to awake to. Our room was of decent size with comfortable bed, warm gas fireplace. docking station for and iPod and big bathroom. That bathroom was one of our low points. Our photos showed a soaking tub and I requested one when I called to confirm. I did not receive one, rather a very nice walk in shower. I was really looking forward to the soaking tub as we were staying there for three nights! Another disappointment was the cost of INTERNET. In this day and age I really do expect free Internet?! Most of our better hotels do offer it! Our room was right near the railway so we had a constant rumble. If this is going to bother you, ask for a room closer to the main of the building. I don't know how the rooms on the upper levels might fare with the sounds. Everyone at the hotel was very pleasant. Room service was fast and efficient. The food was very good as well. The one thing I would advise is if you ask for a cab; don't let them tell you to come down and let them call. You will sit for twenty minutes. Tell the front door man you will be down for a cab in ten! It's a $32 cab ride to the airport or a $40 town car ride. So if you are a tipper ~ you do the math?!

We travel a lot and typically stay in upscale hotels. First, I would like to say that the staff here were very friendly and the housekeeping did an exceptional job of keeping the room clean each night. The hotel itself is an older hotel and I would not consider it an upscale hotel but we still had a pleasant stay. The room itself was small and cozy with a great fireplace. The bathroom on the other hand was great & would definitely hold up in a 4 star hotel. The room itself I would give a 3-star rating. The TVs were not LCD/flat screen and you could see the age of the room. The pillows and the bed were not comfortable for us. The train did keep my husband up at night. I took sleeping pills so I slept through the train. We did not like the fact that you had to pay for internet but this did not take away from our stay b/c there were coffee shops in the area that did offer free wi-fi. The cool part about this hotel was it was over the water. We did enjoy our stay but I am not sure if it would have been so great if we had paid full price on it. We bid on it using Priceline so that is probably why I title it \"a pleasant stay at the Edgewater\". I think if we would have paid full price we would have been disappointed. I would stay here again but not if I had to pay full price....so sorry Edgewater!

Thus, if you pay for a waterside room (which are expensive), you could actually fish out your room window. We splurged for a waterside room with a tub, which is one of the most expensive rooms listed. The room was decorated in a rustic style but had a modern flat-screen television, an up-to-date bathroom, and a great gas fireplace in the corner, which also provides heating on cold nights. Everything was comfortable and well-appointed and the housekeeping was prompt and efficient. The lobby was quite large and pleasant with great views of the water and wonderful places for reading or simply observing the passing of boats. The bar and restaurant also featured great water views. You can eat the full restaurant menu in the bar and the food was excellent--fresh, well-prepared Seattle-style fare. Breakfast was equally excellent. Because the hotel is an overnight stop for cruise passengers either arriving or leaving Seattle for Alaska, it can be quite crowded on the weekends when the ships are in port. Book early to get the room you want. The hotel is also in a great location within easy walking distance to Pike Place Market or the outdoor sculpture garden, as well as other downtown attractions. It is our go-to place to stay in downtown Seattle. The only downside was that we had a first-floor room and could clearly hear any footsteps in the room above us, but as we carry a noise canceling device with us while traveling, the footsteps did not disturb our sleep.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2013-04-18 13:45:57 +0300","author":"Litzy Tromp"},{"content":"The Edgewater Hotel sits over Puget Sound on piers.

The traffic in Las Vegas Blvd (the Strip!) can be pretty bad between Stratosphere and the other casinos towards the south, especially on weekend evenings. But otherwise, the hotel is really good. the rooms are pretty good.

Perhaps we were put in a room directly above the train crossing/intersection because we booked via Priceline but, regardless, be SURE to request a room away from the train tracks!! I was awoken at 2:30 am, 3:30 am, 5 am, 6:30 am.... I called the front desk tearfully requesting ear plugs & they said they had none but that the gift shop did. My next question: \"is the gift shop open now\" -- answer: \"no\" which meant/translation \"you are S.O.L.\". I am not joking when I say I considered sleeping on the bathroom floor to get some quiet rest. The friendly & helpful staff did, however, move our room the next afternoon & I purchased ear plugs & then slept fine (but you don't really anticipate having to wear ear plugs in a 5 star hotel). Anyhow, the train noise is bad. You have been warned. Otherwise, this is a fine hotel. I breathed a sigh of relief (literally) at it being smoke-free. I thought the hotel being casino-free might be a bit of a bummer but it wasn't. Trump offers shuttle service to Wynn & Cesar's throughout the day so if you need to get your gambling fix in it's just an air-conditioned van ride away. The rooms are big & comfortable with great views. They include a microwave, toaster, coffee maker, mini-fridge & flat-screen TV as well as two wardrobes (great for us as we were 2 friends traveling together). The bathroom was HUGE with granite & marble & a large soaker tub. The staff was incredibly friendly & they even do this nice touch of coming around the desk to hand you your check-in receipt & walk you toward the elevator. Very thoughtful when they were clearly busy & had other folks waiting to be helped. The on-site restaurant was fine. Pretty good food but expensive (breakfast buffet is $20 & $5 for a cappuccino or fresh-squeezed orange juice). Trump International is, literally, right across the street from the Fashion Show Mall so it was fun to do four hours of shopping & then stumble back to the hotel. All in all, this is a very good hotel with an exceptionally friendly, courteous & helpful staff. I'd recommend it for others but being that i'm an extremely light sleeper & have battled insomnia I don't think I'd stay there again- the train noise was just too much for me.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":2},"date":"2012-10-04 10:47:20 +0300","author":"Dr. Alberta Johns"},{"content":"Having read some reviews prior to booking here about the train noise, I booked our stay here regardless, and I\"m glad I did.

Beds and linens are the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Hotel was immaculate. When visiting Vegas, we were leery about staying in a hotel with no casino. But the service provided erased any skepticism we has. Check in: extremely fast. From drop off to being in my room took about 10 minutes. This is a no smoking hotel, but the idiots in the next room must have not got the message. When I made a quick call, I was immediately moved to another room. Room: This hotel was originally built as a condo complex, but was converted to a hotel. Room was spacious ( I had a one bedroom suite) with a nice wet bar fridge and microwave. Bath room was luxurious with a Jacuzzi tub, double sinks, and tv in the vanity mirror. Soaps were from the Trump spa and smell wonderful. Robe provided was very soft. Room TV was a 38\"or larger HD screen with a great picture. Location: For me I am fine with the location. Those who want an on strip may not care for the location. This hotel is at the north end a bit off the strip. They provide free shuttle service to the Wynn and Caesars palace. So you can get to just about anywhere you want to go and never move your car. The shuttle leaves about every 10 minutes. The front door of the hotel faces the Nordstrom entrance of the Fashion Show mall. Other that was provided at no charge: Wireless internet had an extremely strong signal. Newspapers delivered every morning. Bottled water placed in room daily. Gym has top notch equipment. I only saw the pool but did not use. It looked very nice but small. Food: All food and beverage we experiences was very good a little pricey, but not over the top. Overall: we loved the lobby that smelled clean and smoke free. Also appreciated not having to maneuver through a casino to get around the hotel. The ease of getting to a casino outside the hotel was enough for our casino needs. Only downside: There were a few of us staying at the hotel on various floors. The elevators are in banks, so to get from a floor in the 40's to a floor in the 60's you had to go down to to up. Elevators were extremely fast, so I almost hesitate to mention this hiccup.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2013-08-12 10:14:52 +0300","author":"Pierce Boyer"},{"content":"the rooms where great!!50 square metres room!!super clean and ith all confort!!

She is very particular and likes to be pampered in a very clean and luxurious environment. This place was just right for what I was looking for. Property: No casino. It is what it is. If you want one, you can go to one. If you must have one in your hotel, well then, stay elsewhere. Didn't try any of the restaurants. Prices at the spa are obscene, even with our included spa credit, unfathomable. The gym was somewhat small, but decent...didn't use it. The pool was alright, rooftop style about half way up the building, but it was only about 4 feet at its deepest point. DJ kinda sucked, but it was def the club/party type scene with beautiful people getting good and toasty. Room: OMG, this is what it's about. You get a fridge, microwave, ipod dock, and best of all a hot tub! Fit both of us, I am big, she is not. The in mirror TV was alright, but hard to see from the tub. The bed was amazing comfy and the robes almost came home with us. They do this private entrance thing with a foyer for two adjacent rooms. It was pretty cool and probably reduced some hall noise. So clean, elegant, and perfect! Service: Well you pay $15/day for it, so I guess it was pretty good. We didn't have any problems, so I guess that is cool. There is only a valet option, so I guess it all balances out with the complimentary valet service. They did bring out free shots for the people at the pool though and it seemed like everyone got them except for us. They just kept skipping around us. Location: Well, its a bit off the strip. There is not much immediately by there. The Wynn is down the street as well as the mall with some decent looking restaurants. There are some liquor stores and pharmacies a few VERY long blocks away, but nothing too close. Although it was easy enough to just drive down to the casinos, park for free and walk around, it was kind of a pain to deal with traffic and parking every time we wanted to go somewhere and there is not much at the hotel itself. If you are drinking, you will have to take a lot of very expensive cabs around because there is not much to do there. Value: This place was perfect for us and really served our purposes. Considering its a 5 star, we got a ridiculous deal online for just about $79/night. When you factor in the $15/day though, it could be less of a good deal at times. The rooms were just too good to be true though. I absolutely would stay at this place again, especially if I could get it for less than $100/night before the resort fee. Definitely worth the driving for the luxury you receive in return.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":3,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2012-06-27 22:31:32 +0300","author":"Max Fadel"},{"content":"summary: while the rooms/lobby were top-notch, the service cannot be considered five-star especially compared with truly five-star hotels like the four seasons. i give this hotel 4-stars while my wife gives this 3.5-stars. especially the train noise would be a deal-breaker for many including us. pros: nice spacious room. comfortable bed. clean. kichinette is a nice plus. my wife thought the spa was nice....small but had all the necessary amenities. good deep tissue massage. friendly staff restaurant food was decent. decent cocktails. relatively inexpensive room rate. con: slow service.....faucet handle was broken and it took almost an hour and a second phone call before this was resolved. we were on 34th floor and yet can hear train horn in the middle of the night which was loud enough to wake me up. (may be you would hear the train noise if you booked a strip-view room instead of a city-view) location is not really on the strip although it is close to the strip. i didn't like that there was no option for self-parking....i don't mind valet service if the parking staff can retrieve cars fast but i can see how this can be a problem when there are so many people who want their cars at the same time.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Value":3,"Rooms":4,"Location":2,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2015-02-16 01:16:40 +0300","author":"Thurman Kihn"},{"content":"My wife and I decided to extend our trip by one night and when I contacted the Bellagio about extending our reservation they were near capacity and it was going to be over $400 for the most basic room.

While it does not have the services/frills of a higher star hotel, it does what it does exceedingly well. I stayed in a single room which was small but very clean and had nice decor. The bed was not fancy but I slept well in the room. While only about 50 metres from the Ramblas, there was no noise in the hotel room at all. The street the hotel is on looks a bit dubious but it is well trafficked both during the day and at night and only a few metres from the Ramblas which is always full of people. The hotel is very secure. The reception staff buzz you in and the hotel is small enough they know who you are in no time. As a solo female traveller I had no qualms about my safety either in the hotel or walking to the hotel even in the evenings. The hotel is really nicely maintained and the decor is modern. Free wifi was great and breakfast (continental) was also done well. The real stand out though were the staff. Very friendly and helpful. They printed out my boarding passes for my flights home, booked my taxi for the next morning and, as I was leaving before breakfast is put on, organised a selection for me to have before I left. The one thing I would have liked was an in-room safe which seemed to be standard at almost all the hotels I stayed in while travelling in Spain but was not in this hotel. I didn't have any concerns about the safety of my belongings in the room, I'm just used to using them as an added precaution. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a good value option in the Ramblas area.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":3,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2014-03-09 04:06:48 +0300","author":"Ibrahim Toy"},{"content":"We can't recommend Hotel Curious enough for people travelling to Barcelona.

The experience of catching a water taxi to the steps of the hotel should be a must for all travelers (spend your euros on that rather than a gondola ride). We stayed in a standard room tucked up in the rafters and it was very comfortable and cleverly appointed to take advantage of the limited space. The view was wonderful. The tea-making facilities and desk nook were appreciated. The breakfast was delicious and the waiting staff were friendly and helpful and all spoke English. So the Ruzzini Palace gets most things right. My only quibble is that my booking supposedly included free wifi and a free welcome drink. When we arrived I had to argue with the reception staff member until he (reluctantly) agreed to let me have 24 hours free access (when we were booked in the hotel for three days). Needless to say, no free welcome drink was forthcoming. Why advertise these 'extras' if you are not going to honour them? (Free wifi really should be a standard feature of any good hotel in 2010.) I didn't need a drink and would not normally expect one but given that it was prominently advertised it made me feel peevish when it wasn't forthcoming. Perhaps we caught this staff member on a bad day or perhaps only guests staying in the superior rooms get the red carpet treatment?

A cool haven in the bustling and jostling of Venice in July. You do need a map to get there. If you follow the instructions on their website, you can find Ruzzini Palace fairly easily. You can also pay a gondolier about 80 euros (7/10) to take you there. Simone at the front desk was really kind and helped me with a restaurant, calling a water taxi, and letting my family tour the palace (it is stunningly beautiful, with fairy glass chandeliers), even though I had checked out by the time my family showed up (we were going on a cruise, and I had come before them). The room I hadâ€”103â€”had two small balconies which overlooked a canal frequented by gondolas. Just watching the slow passage of tourists was a dream. It was a large room for one or two, with a great shower and big flat screen TV and elegant furnishings. I even took a picture of the actual floor because it was like a smooth slice of composite marble or granite with mother of pearl glinting every now and then as I walked from the closet around the room to the office space where there was a mini bar and makings for tea and coffee. The hotel was so peaceful after the mania of San Marcos Square and because I was clueless enough to haul my luggage there. Had I realized how many stair-step bridges there were, I would have paid the gondolier. I will next time. The breakfast was wonderful, and I wished that I had booked longer than one night. I plan to come back with my husband next year for our 25th wedding anniversary, because Venice is a very happy, wonderful, musical place, and I like the person I am when I'm there.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2013-06-16 16:55:38 +0300","author":"Jamal Johnston"},{"content":"My â€˜newâ€™ Husband and I stayed here as part 1 of our honeymoon tour of Italy. We arrived by water taxi from the airport and knew straight away weâ€™d booked a great place.

We were given an upgrade to the junior suite which had a great view of a canal from the 2 large doors that opened onto small balconies. We were also given a complimentary bottle of Prosecco which was a nice touch after such a long journey. The staff were incredibly helpful and pleasant â€“ they helped to organise a gondola trip, advised of restaurants and helped us to plan the train to part 2 of our honeymoon. The hotel is perfectly situated 5 -10 mins walk from both St Marks Square and the Rialto. Breakfast was continental with the usual additions of scrambles egg and bacon - more than enough to start the day. The only bad point is that the air con in the room was very noisy although, as we both travel often, we always take earplugs with us so it wasnâ€™t too much of an issue! In summary, there would be no reason for us to stay anywhere else if we ever visited Venice again. The perfect start to our honeymoon. A note about Venice restaurantsâ€¦.. Do your homework before you go. We stayed in Venice for 4 nights and had only 1 good meal, even given the recommendations from the hotel. Most of the restaurant and mediocre at best and are very highly priced given the quality of the food â€“ even those that are so called â€˜off the beaten trackâ€™. The only good meal we had was in the bar at the Metropole hotel â€“ a reasonably prices meal form the same kitchen as the Michelin restaurant on the top for (which Iâ€™m sure would be great but need to book up to 3 weeks in advance!).

Fortunately, I have one thing less to worry about with GSH.

Their staff recited their policy as I had expected. A couple of hours later however, Donald from GSH called me to tell me that a refund or change of dates was on the way. This is fantastic service.

There was no mini bar - you had to venture down to reception to purchase anything. The room had no compendium or any hotel information at all. Pillows were uncomfortable. We paid for breakfast vouchers, and what a disappointment - slimy eggs with uncooked white slopping around, anaemic baked beans, the most horrible sausages we have ever tasted, and something that looked like bacon but may not have been.

Charging for the internet is a joke. $S35 for 24 hours connection is also daylight robbery, especially when you have paid so much for your stay already.

The rooms are only hard wired too even if you do have to pay the over the top charge. I believe the lobby area is wifi connected but didn't cave in to paying.

For the past 2 years or so I have been staying 1-3 nights at the Crowne Plaza Changi (Airport) on each of my trips to the island nation. My last stay was from 26/1/12 to 29/1/12. I would like to share my experience of it with fellow travellers here. The CPC is located at Terminal 3 of the Singapore Internation Airport. That makes it a very convenient place to stay for traveller in transit for a few (1-4) days. It's makes checking in to the CPC on arrival and checking in for departure flight a breeze. The ambience of the whole place is one of quiet and relaxed pleasantness. The rooms are generously spacious well laid out and contemporarily furnished. It has a beautifully landscaped pool with a in-pool tropical palm treed garden. It's a great pool to spend a hot Singapore afternoon in be it for a leisurely dip or swim laps. It's principal restuarant The Azur serves lovely food with friendly staff service. Most importantly the CPC has fantastic staff team that is the backbone of its operation. They are not just polite but are friendly, engaging and endevour to develop a rapport with their guests. The guest relation team in their Club Lounge is like their A-Team in guests relation. The CPC staff hospitality is the single most important reason for my loyalty to it. The subway station (Singapore Mass Rapid Transit system) is directly below the hotel amd provide easy access to the main shopping district and all parts of Singapore. But if one does not want to wonder far for some light shopping there is a new shopping mall (completed end 2011) just one subway station away. It's call the Changi Point Mall. Also all the 3 terminals of the airport interlinked by unmanned light rails are good for very light shopping and food experiences. There are foodcourts (great for local tastes and MUST TRY), cafes and restuarants. In summary I have no reservation at all in recommending the Crowne Plaza Changi in Singapore to all who visit the island nation. Be it for business and or leisure.

Unfortunately it's only attached to Terminal 3 so you might need to push bags and trolleys around for a while if you arrive at any other terminal - not the hotel's fault. Guests are mostly passengers in transit and airline crew between shifts. The room we had was OK but the hotel does not provide free wireless broadband - an anomaly in a city where wireless access is ubiquitous. If you do want free wireless just wander into the airport building. Other reviews seemed most approving of breakfast - our impression was different. There was 1 coffee machine which spat out a very small amount of coffee and had a digital screen telling guests that there was no milk and staff which we would expect to be there to help in this situation were not visible except at the entrance. Evidently more importance is attached to your right to have breakfast rather than the breakfast itself - fried eggs prepared some time before you ask for one and therefore having the consistency of rubber - toast machines set so low that you get warm bread instead of toast -even asian breakfasts were very poor as there was no decent rice porridge nor any tasty noodle dishes. We can't believe the favourable reviews for breakfast here. Maybe we were just unlucky. The check-in desk for Singapore/Silk air was a definite advantage but it is not available before 10:00 am. Like many others, we chose this hotel because we were travelling elsewhere and near airport accommodation seemed more convenient.

Pros * screened balcony allows you to enjoy the balcony at all hours without worrying about pesky bugs getting into your unit * close to EVERYTHING, e.g. Walmart, restaurants, SeaWorld, Disney, Premium Outlet (Vineland Ave.) * free breakfast (which you can take up to your room) * big pool (albeit a bit cold) * quiet units * heater that worked (it dipped to -6 Celsius one evening) * great for families or big groups Cons * perhaps because we were in one of the original buildings (building #2), it was a bit \"tired\" ... but this wasn't a deal breaker given the value proposition (we used a Facebook promotion code) * two lightbulbs burned out and we twice requested that maintenance come up to replace the bulbs but they never did make the trip to our unit Would I stay again?

The location for us as a family was perfect, over the busiest period of the year. We decided not to stay at one of the resort hotels due to the fact they would be extremely busy and enough time could be spent in queues during the day at Disney. Although The WorldQuest Resort was full over Xmas, you wouldn't have known it. The standards were as high as the rest of the year. We did spend a couple of days by the pool, and this was fairly quiet as alot of people we at the theme parks. There is a small bar which has a limited menu, but for the occasional meal is fine. We didn't use the shuttle provided by the resort to get us to the theme parks, but used a taxi instead - we could then come and go as we pleased. Sweet cakes etc for breakfast didn't suit us, so it is worth ensuring you make a trip to the local supermarket for supplies if you are the same. The condo's are excellent. We had a two bedroomed suite, which had lots of space and made for a really enjoyable stay. All things considered, price, location and service - I would say that you would struggle to find better in the area. One last thing - the concierge service is available from 7am each morning where you can buy your park tickets. Emily - very helpful! We would definately consider booking again.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2014-11-26 23:14:43 +0300","author":"Garfield Larkin"}],"state":null,"geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lon":-4.0914,"lat":53.263},"free_breakfast":true,"email":"reception@bulkeleyhotel.co.uk","phone":"+44 1248 810415","vacancy":false,"free_parking":true,"price":"£50.00 - £150.00","address":"19 Castle Street, Beaumaris, LL58 8AW","description":"Built as a Georgian show piece in 1832, the hotel now boasts a garden with a terrace, as well as a fine restaurant, a coffee shop, a bar and a lounge.

The kitchen had everything you would need to cook and eat everynight if you wanted, with a washing machine and tumble drier.We also had a large balcony overlooking the pool area. This was very nice but the pool was open till 11pm and sometimes groups arrived late and headed straight for the pool, while we were in bed. We had some maid service included in our package, so the beds were made towels were changed and the dishwasher filled and started for us. We were disappointed to find out that the maid did NOT clean or bleach the toilets. It is ideally situated for all the parks, literally 5 minutes from Disney. (It's right behind the Nickelodeon hotel) The pool was always spotlessly clean, with clean towels always available. There was a complimentary breakfast thrown in, it is not up to much, but you could eat there every day for free, so who would complain about it? Overall this is a very good resort.

I was impressed with the condo-style rooms, large living area and kitchen. We (family of 4) had a 3 bedroom 2 bath condo and shared it with my sister's family of 5 and grandparents - so three families total. The condo was big enough for all, I only wish we had 3 bathrooms since we had to share with the grandparents. The kitchen was well stocked with at least one of everything we needed (except specialty things like rice cookers) and we cooked quite a few dinners there. It also had dishwashing detergent and dishsoap which was nice. The only problem we encountered was that with \"limited housekeeping\" they did not check toilet paper and replace it. This seemed to be strange and I wonder if we had called and requested if they would have supplied these necessities. My mother just bought replacements. The website lists a surcharge for wireless internet service. However, there was free internet access through a cable at the counter/bar area of the kitchen. This served our needs nicely and we thought this was a nice unexpected free service. The location was as good as any other we saw in the area. It was right behind the Nickelodian resort and easy to find after your first visit. The lobby area was nice and we enjoyed the free breakfast a few mornings. It was good quality food, but limited to starches (pastries and bagels), cereal and milk, and apples along with coffee and juice. My only suggestion would be to add filtered water - only water available was from the sink in the prep area. We were in building 6 which was a considerable walk (maybe 5 minutes) from the lobby - especially when you're trying to get everyone ready and out the door - so we only ate the free breakfast when we took the shuttle and were going to the lobby area anyways. I saw plenty of folks filling grocery bags with bagels and apples to take back to their rooms. We ended up buying cereal and milk and having that in our room most of the mornings to save time. I used the gym facilities a few times and while small it contained everything I needed for my workout including a few treadmills, free weights and yoga mats. It also had TV's available and towels. Filtered water was available here and I once I found that out I got my water for breakfast here - it's just down the hall. The pool itself was very nice. I wish the heat had been turned up since it was VERY cold when first entering. But we warmed up to it soon and had a blast! The hot tub was a little dirty in my opinion but much warmer then the pool (but not super hot). Tripadvisor was lacking any info on the free shuttle, so I kept our info sheet to post for posterity. Here is the info: - Reserve a shuttle and pick up a boarding pass from the guest services/ticket area in their \"marketplace\" at least 15 minutes prior to departure on the same day. This gives them the opportunity to try to sell you tickets which are actually a good rate (cheaper then gate prices when we checked into it). - Shuttles to Epcot depart at 9:20 am, 11:30 am, 1:20 pm. Then you have to use Disney's internal (free) transportation to the other parks. The free shuttle was \"average\" - a smaller bus that fit approx. 50 people. - Shuttle picks up right outside the lobby area - past the covered pull-through area - you have to be waiting and watching for it or it might not stop. They were mostly on time for the two days we used it. - Worldquest was their last stop so while you got a direct ride to the park, you also run the risk of having to stand or not being allowed boarding since it's full. We had an especially hard time taking a double stroller - there was just no room for it besides in the passenger seat at the front of the bus. The drivers were very nice but want to be tipped for their effort. One had the whole bus sing happy birthday to my 2-year-old on the way to the park which I thought was very nice - and of course he got a tip! - We found the free shuttle to be effective, however when taking the earliest available shuttle we still arrived in the parks one hour after opening - and anyone familiar with Disneyworld knows the first hour in the park is the most important since it's the least crowded. So most of the other days we just paid for parking to get full advantage of that extra hour. - Same for the return: you loose time in the park if you use the shuttle. Return from Epcot was 6:30 pm, 8:45 pm, and last shuttle was 10:30 pm. They made it clear that these were the DEPARTURE times and that if you weren't there on time they would leave without you. Since the Magic Kingdom closed after 11 pm each night, if you took the shuttle you don't get to see the night-time parade, the fireworks and spend that extra time in the parks. And remember that it takes at least 30 minutes to get back to the Epcot area from the other parks, taking away more valuable time. - Good thing about the return trip: you're the first hotel dropped off = short trip back. Which is nice at the end of a long day. - Another disadvantage of the shuttle is that you can't come back to rest in the middle of the day when it's very crowded and your kids need a nap. No return to hotel until 6:30 pm and no departures to Disney in the afternoon/evening. - Would I use the free shuttle again? Probably not. Unless: I didn't care about getting there at gate opening, I didn't have a large stroller, I didn't want to return to my hotel for a nap in the afternoon, and I didn't mind returning before the evening festivities. My mom was happy to use the shuttle since all of this applied to her. It just wasn't for my little \"disney-crazy\" family. Overall I was happy with our stay. I just won't factor in the free shuttle or free breakfast when doing the cost comparison with other hotels. If it's still a good deal without that stuff then I'd stay here again in an instant!","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2014-07-29 06:05:31 +0300","author":"Billy Mueller"},{"content":"We just returned from a week in Orlando - Dad, Mom, 15-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter.

We drove down from Mass. and were looking for a suite/condo setup so the kids could have their own room. Since we were on a budget, any setup like that in the parks was out of the question. We chose Worldquest based on price, location to the parks and the overall ratings from previous guests. From check-in to check-out, all the employees were great to deal with. Anytime we had a question, they answered it with a smile and most thanked us for staying there. The room was huge, the pictures on their site do not do any justice to the size of the rooms. Everything was clean, the floors, bathrooms, bedrooms and kitchen. The kitchen was fully stocked with anything and everything you would need to cook and feed your family. As a point of info for anybody who needs ice for their coolers on the way back home, the freezer has its own ice maker and makes alot in one night. I was able to fill my cooler with 2 nights worth of ice making. We never used the hot-tub in the master bedroom or the dishwasher, but everything else worked good. The kids had their own bedroom with bathroom which worked out really good for us. And they loved it too because they were able to play with their toys or video games right in their room while we were able to take care of packing, cooking or just getting ready for the parks. The washer and dryer were a great addition to the room, we were able to wash towels and our clothes before we left so we didnt have multiple suitcases of laundry when we got back home. We stayed in building one. The room was very quiet, we never heard any or our neighbors. It was a short walk, only a couple of minutes over to the clubhouse for breakfast in the morning. We were there at 6:30 most mornings and all the food was out and ready to be eaten. Not a big variety of food but it tasted good and we didnt have to pay a small fortune every morning eating at a restaurant or buying more food to make in the room. The pool as pretty big and always clean. Every morning I would see a worker at the pool cleaning it. We never went to the tiki bar, the fitness area or the variety store, so I cannot comment on that. One thing if you need a luggage carrier, ask for it when you check in, there seems to be only a few around for the entire property and had to wait a little while for one to show up before we could unload our truck at check-in. The location is very close to Disney. We stayed in Disney about 5 years ago at Corondo Springs and at Worldquest we were closer to some of the parks. Unlike one of the previous guests I was able to use my gps and bring me to the front door. But off of the main st to turn onto their property, there is no streetlight, so we would look for the Nickelodeon hotel and we knew to turn from there. With the exception of a couple minor problems that the staff was able to take care of quickly, we had no problems and would easily stay here again.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":4},"date":"2012-03-29 20:32:49 +0300","author":"Miss Lyda Ondricka"},{"content":"Stayed at World Quest in Aug/09.

Also, if you want your sheets changed, there is a fee. There is a fee for everything they do at the resort other than take your trash. While we were there, we had to call the front desk after being at the park all day, just to have someone come get our trash and bring us towels and washcloths so that we could take a shower!! And, we paid in advance for the service which is what made it even more frustrating. So actually, they didn't even do it with the fee until we would call. We were very disappointed with the service and the stay at the resort. If tyou plan on using the shuttle provided, be prepared. It only runs 3 times in the morning and 3 times in the evening. And, it drops you off at Epcot to catch the monorail. So, make sure you allow an hour just to get to Magic Kingdom or anywhere other than Epcot. We ended up spending so much money on taxis because of the inconvenient shuttle schedule. It is a beautiful resort, but the convenience and service is not worth the view! We are definately going to do our homework next trip.","ratings":{"Overall":2},"date":"2015-09-19 20:53:25 +0300","author":"Miss Noelia Wolff"}],"state":null,"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-0.46589,"lat":52.134},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+44 1234 799988","vacancy":false,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":"2 St Marys Street, MK42 0AR","description":"Modern concrete block on the other side of the river from the Swan."}

A breakfast of toast, muffin or roll with juice and coffee or tea can be ordered which will be brought to your room at your specified time costing nothing except tip. My maid service was very timely which I liked. When I got back around noon from my morning jaunt the room was always clean and made up. The reception and cleaning staffs were polite.

Perfect for giving parents heart attacks when toddlers are jumping on beds. I was told this set-up was in \"all of their rooms.\" 3) He, she, it resorts-to no WIFI. They will say they do but it is only in the lobby. Nice. I have a million dollars in the bank, it is just not in my bank account. But they do offer Ethernet cords which would be helpful in 1998. 4) We resort-to the lowest common denominator. It was our wedding anniversary. We asked for a bottle of wine. BTW- There is no room service so we were transferred to their \"bistro.\" You would think I was asking for gold. They couldn't make that happened. Also, the basic free continental breakfast was great. Only it was 9 dollars per person. But this was unnecessary for us as the aroma of breakfast lingered in our room for our first day. It smelled like hash browns. We were told it was probably our neighbors. Dem da breaks! So yes, it is a resort. This should be your last resort.

Check-in was very quick - you have to take an elevator to get to the lobby if you're coming from outside or from the parking lot, which is an interesting design.

King-size bed, flat screen TV, desk, chair with leg rest. The washroom was okay - the shower has this ledge that goes along the inside which is great for putting all of our shampoo and soap from home. We could quite clearly hear conversations between people in the hallways that were passing through - there were a few signs in the room asking guests to be quiet after 9pm. They must have had noise issues in the past. Bed was very comfortable and had tons of pillows. Check-out was quick but the elevator area to get to the parking lot/main exit got a little congested.

There is a very nice cafe with a nice buffet for breakfast. It might have the buffet for lunch too but we were always out sightseeing at that time. And the price was right!! And-----one of the greatest and unexpected features about staying here is that there is a parking lot right across the street that is MUCH more reasonably priced than parking at the hotel. We rented a car for 4 days to do out of town sightseeing and this parking lot was wonderful---a great price for overnight if you are just out by 8am. The only negative is that my sister and I had specified separate beds and when we arrived very late, as they had been informed would be the case, they had only a room with a king bed.

I had to download the app to my iPhone and write this review, because I was so upset that I was lied to by the front desk lady, as well as the manger. When I confronted them with their lies, they had the IQs to create more blatant lies. I stayed at the corner room on the 16th floor, it was. Good size room with 2 beds. I asked for another rollaway bed, I had done this at the Marriott Copley square hotel where the room was much smaller. The front desk lady ( extremely unpleasant) said 'no , it's a fire harzard'. I knew it was a lie, because Boston rules And regulations should applied go both hotels. I asked for proof of of the rules, she could not provide. Her manager called , he said it was not Boston reggulation, but hyatt's policy, however, this is a policy he can not show me ( a customer), when asked why a hotel has some secret policy which is not open to customer, he again changed to another story, saying something like the maid does not want to have a rollaway bed because it is too crowded. How strange? I told him this room is 30% larger than the one I stayed at the marriot Boston, if it was not crowded at the Marriott ( they always brought the rollaway when asked) , why it should be crowded at the Haytt? Here's his answer: ' you can go back to the Marriott' So for those of you who've traveled around, here's your taste of the professionalism at the Hyatt Boston. I am extreme upset, but this is the July 4th , leaving is not an easy option, my only choice is get on here to write my review.","ratings":{"Overall":1,"Service":1,"Value":1,"Rooms":3,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":4},"date":"2015-06-23 20:54:25 +0300","author":"Vicky Koss"}],"state":null,"geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lon":-7.15398,"lat":57.71728},"free_breakfast":false,"email":null,"phone":null,"vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":"£12 for a bed, or £7 if you're under 18.

Prior to arriving I had applied for several types of standby upgrades, including the Business Plan upgrade. I discovered on arrival that I got the Business Plan upgrade. I received a letter from the front desk clerk informing me of what this included (internet, local and long distance phone calls, one breakfast daily, a bottle of water, etc). Boy was I glad I saved that letter. The staff at this hotel simply don't know what they offer. One of the days we went to breakfast. I had to argue with the hostess that I was 100% positive that one breakfast was indeed included on my room rate. And upon checkout I was told that long distance calls were not covered. I pulled out the letter to show the desk clerk that indeed they were covered. She quickly changed it and said that they had just changed what the business plan offered. Fair enough but then management needs to be better about communicating to staff about what is included in the rates. I don't want to have to go to the front desk to check out and get a corrected bill. I would rather have checked out online in my room. But this wasn't an option as the included charges had to be removed from the bill after the fact. Very annoying. Another annoying thing were the bellboys trying to hijack our luggage constantly. One bellman came over to my husband and TOOK his suitcase despite his protestations that he could manage it himself. It seems like they are simply desperate for tips. Or that's how it comes across to me. The location is good. The rooms were ok. But I wouldn't rate it high for cleanliness - I noticed an M&M on the carpet and it was still there the next day. Same for the gum wrapper that was near the chair. Bed slept ok though. All in all, I wouldn't say that it was a particularly good value for the money.

I needed a hotel I could stay in long term, so I stayed in a few different hotels until I found one that could make me feel comfortable, like home. This hotel had the worst service of all the Boston hotels I tried in that time period. The day I arrived, my companion and I were tired, so we decided to have a little bit to eat and some drinks in their restaurant, I can't remember the name, but it's the one by the lobby. The service was miserably sad. The hostess, who was holding menus, asked if we were here for dinner. I said yes. She told us to seat ourselves and never gave us menus. I thought she might follow behind us with menus, but they never came until we requested them. The service was incredibly slow even though the restaurant was mostly empty. It took us 20 minutes just to get water and we only received it after we asked for it. The drinks took nearly 30 minutes to arrive. I watched two people hold our meals and look around at tables for at least 10 minutes. They put the meals down, walked away, walked back, looked at tables, looked at the computer. I tried to make eye contact, and indicate that they were looking for my table, but it was useless. The food eventually made it to my table cold. I knew we couldn't expect to keep drinking at this place, and we were too tired to find someplace else on a Friday night, so I decided to go to the room, and invite a few friends over for drinks. I thought just one friend was coming, so I ordered 2 bottles of cava and 3 glasses. My friend called, and said she would bring her boyfriend, so I called room service back to see if I could add an additional glass to my order. I was told that it had not left yet, so the extra glass would be added. About 15 minutes later, my cava arrived with only 3 glasses. The person who brought it said that she would be right back because she forgot a wine bottle opener. I told her we don't need a wine bottle opener for cava, but that we had ordered 1 extra glass. She told me she would bring it right up. My friends arrived and started drinking. Over 20 minutes later, I still had no fourth glass. I called room service, who told me it would be there right away. 15 minutes later, I still had no glass. I called guest services, who told me they would send me a glass. 15 minutes later, there was no glass. I called the night manager, who told me they would send a glass. 15 minutes later, after an entire bottle was finished, a man knocked on my door, shoved a glass into my hand so quickly that I almost didn't catch it, and took off without a smile or even a glance in my direction. I called the night manager to say that it had arrived, but that I was entirely disappointed with the service this evening. The manager said that there was nothing she could do, but that she would have someone call me and apologize the next day. I never received any sort of apology for this horrible evening. The next morning, I had forgotten to put the privacy sign on the door, so when housekeeping came around and knocked, it was no surprise. We were already up and getting ready for brunch, so it was not an inconvenience. My companion answered the door and said that we were not quite ready to leave. The housekeeper rolled her eyes, and asked when we would be gone. I was shocked. It wasn't like we were staying over check out time, I had two more nights here. I started to wonder if we had been blacklisted for complaining the night before. After this, I decided to limit my use of the hotel services as much as possible. I ordered breakfast the next morning. It arrived, and I was setting it up, when the server returned to my room because he had given me a plate that belonged to another hotel guest. So I suppose he just exchanged the plates because my eggs were returned to me cold and overcooked. I just ate them because I came to realize that a request to correct a problem is of no use here. The next morning, I stuck to a continental breakfast, which arrived on time and warranted no complaints. As for other issues, I really donâ€™t think they are worth commenting on after all the service concerns, but Iâ€™ll mention them quickly. The dÃ©cor was pleasant. The bedding was comfortable, but I found the pillows to be too tough. The comforter was shedding feathers, but they were very soft feathers. The restaurant menu was unappealing. In general, the food is named by the method of cooking and the protein. I would normally have cared that I was eating at a place with a menu that you might find at a truck stop, but I couldnâ€™t even care about that with the service issues. If I had even had mediocre service, or if management had made any effort to correct this horrible experience, I would have given them a higher rating, and I would have felt like I could recommend them to others. However, it was horrible to be committed to staying in this hotel, and I will never put myself in that situation again, and I certainly would never advise a friend to be stuck there.","ratings":{"Overall":1,"Service":1,"Value":1,"Rooms":3,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":3,"Sleep Quality":3},"date":"2012-08-04 20:38:31 +0300","author":"Kennith Ledner"},{"content":"We stopped two nights in Boston at the end of a US trip and picked a Hyatt hotel at random as I expect them to be of a good standard.

This is not, of course,. something to ruin a stay, but noticeable in what's known as a 4 star hotel. Views were great as was the location of the hotel; walking distance to most spots or a quick jaunt on the T. Pool was okay. Small, but fine for a city hotel. Definitely about half the size of the photos. Service was okay. I jokingly asked the woman in \"gift shop\" what the markup on the gatorade was (@ $4/bottle) and she was extemely vicious in her reply. I truly was just kidding but she apparently didn't think it was funny. We were given connecting king rooms which obviously doesn't work with 2 adults and four children. This took quite some time to get resolved and the front desk person was not too helpful. The concierge was always helpful and gave us pretty good recommendations. The biggest plus is the location.

The king bed was outstanding and probably the most comfortable bed that I have ever slept in. The decor of the room looked new and modern. There was a small chair in the room that I used a lot to read my Boston maps in. It was very comfortable for the size of that chair. We used the concierge several times while we were in Boston to find restaurants and trolley stops and tours. The concierge told us about a restaurant called \"Kennedys.\" We ate at the restaurant and we loved the food and the service was great! My husband used the workout room about 4 times while we were there and he said it was the best one that he had seen in any hotel. One thing that we found convenient while we were at the Hyatt was that you could enter Macy's store and walk through it to get to our hotel. It was 26 degrees outside and we were thrilled to be able to stay inside instead of braving the cold wind. My husband had left his gloves at home so he bought a pair at that Macy's. All of the people working at the Hyatt went out of their way to be helpful and friendly! Our floor was very quiet and we never heard any noises outside our door in the hallway.

When I sopke from the centre to the fron t desk, I realised that the Old Southern Hospitality attitude was sadly lacking in Robert, the chap with whom I spoke. This was verified upon meeting him - the TV programme he never took his eyes away from , was obviously of more importance to him than our booking. Because of the lack of accommodation in the hotel, we were warned that our room was windowless - and less said about it the better although I will say that it was contained in an annex room that opened directly onto the street. as we, and one poor dear lady, found to her cost! The weather was qppalling and the only area for breakfast was outside in the inner courtyard which would be charming in the sunlight but quite disasterous in the middle of a rainstorm. The breakfast woman was less than helpful, considering we had no idea what we were supposed to do in these circumstances and her attitude was aggessive and offensive. In spite of breakfast being included, we only ate there once more when we were assured she wasn't on duty! Confrontation is the last thing you need on your yearly holiday. It was with some relief, therefore, that the front desk rota changed, and we met Lillian - a pure joy of a lady, who smoothed things out for us, transferred us to a far better room with balcony, as soon as it was available and proffered local advice on where to go and what to eat. We found the cleaning staff to be happy and chatty but they are not the Public face of the Chateau hotel, after all. All in all , the Chateau suffers from lack of obvious management structure, a lack of management interest and a sense of hostile hospitality, apart from the exception of the dear lady in Reception.. The owner needs to shake the whole place up, spend money on repairing curtains that don't close properly, unstick windows that are painted up and won't open, damp that affects the bathrooms and certainly advise the staff that smoking in public areas is just not on.with the type of guests who would pay the kind of money the Chateau demands.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":1,"Value":3,"Rooms":2,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":3},"date":"2014-04-12 05:16:56 +0300","author":"Monserrat Koch"},{"content":"The worst hotel in america!

On the second night some friends came to town and discovered a mouse in the bathroom. When we reported it to the front desk, they acted as if it was not a big deal and didn't offer to move our room.

The hotel is clean, the location is great, the rooms were nice (shower heads and pressure not so much), but both of our rooms had horribly cold water in the shower in the morning. I showered at around 7am and was fine. My wife in our room and my in-laws in their room tried to shower between 8-9 am and got tepid at best, icy at worst, and all temperatures in between. I called the front desk and asked if something was wrong. She said no one had complained that morning, and she sent the maintenance man up right away. He arrived promptly, told us he gets that call a lot and it's because we were on the 13th floor (the first floor of rooms in the building evidently) and \"the hot water comes from the roof, so you just need to try later\". Try later? You are a Hilton property right? He was very polite, and I believe I understand how gravity works, but it's ridiculous to have a hotel where you KNOW some of your guests are going to have cold water if they take a shower at peak usage, e.g. 8-9 in the morning. I went down to the front desk and she said \"No one has complained this morning.\" I said maybe they haven't this morning, but you can't tell me they've never complained at all, and she admitted that she does get that call from time to time. I told her I had the same hotel booked for three nights this coming week and I needed to cancel and move to another Hilton property. She moved me to the top floor so it shouldn't be a problem... for me anyway. Apologies to the poor schmucks on the bottom floors that day.... Long story short... really nice place, nice little pool that's warm for the kiddos, and a great location, just get a top floor or don't plan on a nice hot shower on a late December Chicago morning... yikes.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":3,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2013-12-18 22:51:08 +0300","author":"Bart Simonis PhD"},{"content":"We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for 5 nights.

The Hotel Burnham is my new favorite. I had the pleasure to stay in a Executive suite with an amazing view of the Chicago Theatre and Macys and from the other side Millennium Park. The room was large for a boutique hotel with a separate living area. Bed was extremely comfortable. Everything from the Atwood Cafe, to the elevators to the opulent hotel lobby features the charm that Chicago is all about. Another huge bonus is the location of the Burnham. You are literally a stones throw from the Lake subway on the red line, another block to the blue line. You can get to either O'hare or Midway airport with ease using public transit if you wish. With the location and decor aside, the main part of this hotel that sets it apart is the service. Whatever we needed at the Hotel Burnham, we got. The front desk was sincere and helpful. The housekeeping staff left personal notes and did an excellent job cleaning up our suite. Everything from check in to check out had a personal touch that you just can't get at a Radisson or major hotel chain. My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed the nightly wine receptions.

The hotel is well located in the centre of Chicago right on the shopping streets. We walked everywhere and didn't miss having a car. Our room was big with a huge bed (although apparently we only had a standard room). Beautiful clean bathroom which was kept immaculate during our stay by housekeeping. Loved the touch of the zebra or leopard print dressing gowns!! We had a room overlooking the street but we were high enough not to be kept awake by the road noise. The staff were excellent - friendly and helpful but all very efficient. We did not eat in the restaurant but it did look nice but we had no food included in our room price. One piece of advice - join as a Kimpton In Touch member and you get free Wifi and $10 to spend on the mini bar. Excellent touches like free coffee to take away in the morning and free wine reception in the evening for all guests.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":5,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2015-01-26 06:09:34 +0300","author":"Kasey Hessel"},{"content":"My wife and I arrived on a Sunday morning at 9:00 am on Aug 21st. We did not expect any rooms to be available since most of Chicago was booked for the weekend. We checked out bags in a holding room til the afternoon. We eventually made it back to the hotel around 3:00. The check in was lightning quick. We stayed in the historic section on 12 th floor in room 1205. We had great view of State and Washington and everywhere else. We had a deluxe queen comfortable bed , nice couch, desk, closet, mini bar, and flat screen. The showers had the best water pressure that I can ever remember. Aveda bath products if you're imto that sort of thing. I'm used to Hampton inn generic myself. The Burnham had a restaurant near the lobby that I wish we would have visited instead of Quartino Italian up the road. The folks working the front desk were friendly and very helpful. The location was good, right next to the blue and red line stations. If i return to Chicago, I will most certainly reserve a room here again. I recommend the Hotel Burnham, an Incubus concert at Northerly pavillion, and Bobby's bike tours.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":4,"Value":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-08-16 01:09:39 +0300","author":"Angelica Hudson"},{"content":"This hotel is very nice and clean.

It was great. Martin, the front desk manager is a charming man who was kind enough to get my wife and me a corner room which allowed us to look up Washington to see the top of the Gehry pavilion in Millenium Park and down the truly great street, State Street, to see the Chicago theatre. We were directly kitty corner across the street from what was the flagship Marshall Field's store, sadly, now Macy's. It was a short 2 block walk to visit Millenium park and an easy walk a few more blocks to the Art Institute. Or, we could have turned left and walked the magnificent mile. The room was lovely and met all of our needs. We had breakfast in the bustling ground floor restaurant and it too was excellent. They also set out coffee for those who just want to grab a free cup of joe on your way out the door. Kimpton properties are uniformly well run and exude a \"fun\" vibe. This may be their very best property. The physical plant and the staff are excellent. My kids room was small, only 175 square feet but they use every inch and it did not feel crowded.

My issue revolves around making reservations for international guests and I was to book 6 rooms for two days (being a good customer). I never received any confirmations as promised and after the second day, I called and was transferred 4 times, cut off, and received a recorded prompt to leave a voice message. In a professional and courteous manner, I did just that. Four hours later, no call back from the hotel. I then called back on three occasions and it seems like everyone is a manager when you ask for one. Another important aspect of this is was the fact that I was booking direct through the hotel and not via a third party which can cause conflicts. I am shocked frankly. A four star hotel messes up reservations placed on a credit card twice. Then to top everything, when I went to book the rooms, the special group rate of $118.50 per room jumps to $190 and the arrogant representative on the line states, that is the best I can do. Luckily, I went to another hotel a block away, received rates for $90 for a better upscale hotel, and received an email confirmation within minutes. I am not sure why this happened and who is inept at the Burnham Chicago (A Kimpton Hotel), but never again will I stay at this chain.

The hotel is in a great location at the corner of State and Washington in the hear of the Loop. Kimpton has renovated the old Reliance building and the work they have done is stunning. I arrived at about noon and my room was not yet ready. They took my cell phone number and gave me a call when my room was done (about 2 pm). In the meantime, I took a walk and had lunch. The room I had was on the 10th Floor and had a queen bed. The bed was very comfortable and I found the room easy to work in. The bathroom was the perfect size for a solo traveler and being a member of the InTouch program made internet usage free and provided me with a $10 minibar credit. Both mornings of my stay I had breakfast in the Atwood restaurant in the lobby. While I only had the continental breakfast (orange juice, coffee or tea, toast or pastry), it was served quickly and with a smile. If I had to pick something that was lacking at the hotel, it would be the workout room. Located on the 3rd floor, it was small and had only 2 treadmills, 1 elliptical, 1 stationary bike and some limited weights. I used the gym both days, but would have loved to have had a little more variety. Overall, this was a wonderful hotel for business and I would not hesitate to stay there again for either business or pleasure.

We just spent a long weekend in Chicago. As an architect, the fact that I am staying in the Reliance Building --- so brilliantly restored --- is a dream come true. It is part of American architectural history. This is one of the first skyscrappers in the world! The elevator lobby is a sight to behold. We stayed on the 14th floor. The room door had the original hardware. It is a very compact hotel, and the way spaces are utilized is very fascinating and efficient. Even though we were right next to the elevators, there wasn't much noise. We would hear the \"L\" go by, but that is lovingly considered as part of the experience of being in the center of the Chicago \"Loop\". Even little quirks in the room such as loose cabinet doors and bathroom doors that wouldn't close entirely didn't bother us much. We are within walking distance to many historical downtown buildings, and two blocks away from the amazing Millenium Park and Art Institute (with its new Modern Wing). The Hotel Burnham is rated as a 3-star hotel, although with all the history, charm, and character I feel it is definitely a priceless 5-star experience.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":4},"date":"2013-10-01 14:57:39 +0300","author":"Else Abbott"},{"content":"Definitely the best service at any hotel in Chicago so far.

It was a bit dark, and could have benefited from a lamp next to the sofa for reading purposes. The service was rather friendly although not too polished at times. Attention to detail seems an issue: when I checked into my room, there was a card and gift addressed to another guest and my check-out took awhile owing to a credit card mix-up. Warning for those who like to use room service: there is none at this hotel during a renovation of the restaurant downstairs (there is, however, a complimentary Continental breakfast spread in the morning in the lobby, which includes a fireplace). One thing I really liked at this hotel was the long list of complimentary 'on request' amenities for the rooms, including humidifiers.

I am now addicted to Kimpton hotels and will stay there as often as possible in my travels. Now most reviews are not found credible without some constructive criticism. While I have very little serious criticism of the hotel, I found the food selections, and in particular, the wine, at their restaurant slightly overpriced considering the competition of world-class dining in the area. However, the food and service was still, by-and-large, above average. Considering many respected hotels have much worse food quality but at inflated prices, this hotel's dining is definitely ahead of the game. Overall, a more more memorable hotel stay.

The Kimpton group, which owns this hotel, was always pet friendly when we had stayed at their other properties, and were just as much so here. Our dog is a 55 lb Shepherd mix, not a little lap dog, and that didn't phase them either. If you aren't into travelling with your pets, however, this place is still a gem. And as an aside, I didn't see anyone else there with their pets during our stay, so I would doubt the place is overrun with them for people who don't like animals. They also had us on a pet-friendly floor - so presumably you could also make sure you were on a floor without animals if you had allergies or something. The pet friendly rooms did not smell wierd or have anything wrong with them, they seemed just like all their other rooms - just, presumably, away from people who didn't want to be by animals! The location is fantastic - you could walk to all the great downtown spots from here, and you are smack in the middle of the theatre district. The rooms are small - but have very high ceilings and practically floor to ceiling windows, so they feel much larger than they are. Nicely decorated, that is the Kimpton hotel \"thing\" - all their properties are funky, boutique, edgy but always comfortable. Great bed at the Burnham, which I have luckily also had when staying at other properties of theirs. We didn't eat at the restaurant because we had other plans for our meals while there, but it was always full of people and the menu looked appealing. Staff was very friendly, even when our dog woofed at those wearing hats (she's a Shepherd mix, what else can I say?) and helpful (with directions and similar). We paid $152 + tax and valet parking - and again I think this is one of the best values for the money in downtown Chicago.

Note - if you want to be very handy to the Mag Mile (N. Michigan Ave) or the Convention Center, this is not the place. But it's good to see a vibrant downtown all around you, with transportation readily available. For transportation, the subway (Red line) is across the street, the El is a block or two away, and taxis and buses can handle the rest. Leave your car (parking is expensive, but this is downtown, and any major cities have comparable high prices downtown), unless you need to drive a distance - parking in the city in any desired destination is usually difficult. Yes - it's pricey, but it offers excellent furnishings and very good service. The concierge desk was helpful. The only glitch in service was maid service one day, when some things in the room were missed. It was reported, and didn't happen again. Lobby staff (front desk, doormen, bellmen) were excellent. The in-house restaurant (Atwood Cafe) receives very good reviews. Room service is from there. We ate there one lunch - it was good, but crowded (tables too close), service only fair, and not worth the money. There are very good restaurants in the Loop, even in walking distance. (Trattoria #10 around the corner, the Berghoff, the Russian Tea Time, for example) Other restaurants (we like Greek restaurants in Greektown and mideastern on the north side) are a taxi ride away. A tip - the Corner Bakery is a chain all over town - ask for directions to the nearest one(s). They have good pastries, sandwiches, at reasonable prices. A bottled juice from the Walgreens next door, a pastry, and coffee made in the room was a fine breakfast. Contrary to what was on the Kimpton website, this is not on the Mag Mile (that's a mile away), and Millenium Park is not across the street (it's 2 blocks to the east). There's some interesting shopping on State Street (not as glitzy and huge as Mag Mile). The views from the room (we had a corner, with views up State Street, and over to the lake) are fantastic. If you like being in the heart of a bustling city, this is a good choice. It's small enough to feel personalized, and always felt safe. (Admittedly, we were not out real late at night.) We were there as tourists (had lived near Chicago many years ago). The Culture Center (with a good bookstore and noon concerts) is a block away. Took an easy busride to Museum Campus (Field Museum - the best).

Not cheap but centrally located on the edge of the Loop. If you want shopping fall out of bed and you are in Marshall Fields , a little walk and you are on Michigan Avenue or on the river doing a sightseeing trip. Big tip- the blue line CTA from O Hare airport stops yards from the hotel, great if you have loads of luggage but only want to spend $1.75 on transport! I read that the rooms were cramped. I wasnt in a suite yet the space was fine and the view unbelievable. When we were there we had a prime view of the Memorial Day parade down State Street from our room. The room surroundings and fittings were reminiscent of a golden area, based on Art Deco. The toiletries are Aveda and, its true, there is a turndown service with chocolates left on the bed on your return (except on the last night!!). And.......you also get free Starbucks from 6-9am in the lobby so you can take a cup back to your room. When I went down the night shift concierge was very friendly and helpful. There is also a free wine reception in the evening. The Attwood Cafe is rated but we didnt try it. Instead we tried deep dish pizzas at Guardinos chain (you will have a job to finish one!), Pot Belly sandwiches and had breakfast in Johnny Rockets, just like a 50's diner.

The hotel was just okay. It met our basic needs - having a place to sleep and a place to shower away all the NOLA humidity. Other than that, the room that we stayed in was out-of-date - worn down furniture, dim lighting, carpet flooring, etc. However, the location of this place was great! It's located in the Garden District and there's a trolley right outside the hotel. Had we known this, we would've opted out of getting a rental car - which by the way, we'd pay $$ for daily parking at the hotel. So for those of you looking to travel to NOLA, get the multiple day trolley pass! It's so worth it! Altogether, I would like to go back to NOLA.

The Avenue Plaza resort didn't disappoint. It is located in the Garden District along St Charles Ave. It is far enough away from the French Quarter and CBD in a quieter suburb, yet close enough to hop on a streetcar and be there in 10 minutes, less the hassle of trying to park or pay for the privilege in expensive car parks. However, word of warning, streetcars during busy periods can be very crowded and unpleasant. Also be sure to say to the driver you want a day pass, (if you want one which is the best option), before putting money into the ticket machine. Or else you'll be yelled at! (Albeit in Southern good humor). The hotel offers valet parking but enough free parking can be found on the street within easy access to the hotel. The room we stayed in was a one bedroom suite on the 10th floor with foldout bedding in the lounge in addition to the big bedroom. It was very clean, the kitchenette was excellent and the view from the suite window was fantastic. For an even better view, the rooftop terrace accessed from the 12th floor is great for a panoramic view of New Orleans and suburbs. Reception desk assistance was disappointing, I asked where I might find the nearest post office and was told to wait for the tour desk manager, who never appeared. Porters were sought, by repeated requests over a lengthy period but never came to assist. Laundry appliances were unreliable, but as I don't like to judge a vacation by doing a mundane chore like laundry, whilst on it, I perhaps should let that pass! LOL. Plentiful restaurants and convenience stores are closeby. The business centre in the hotel had three computer terminals to access internet 24/7. Lifts worked efficiently and the outdoor areas were good. Overall a pleasant stay in a comfortable and well located hotel.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":3,"Value":4,"Rooms":4,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-11-07 05:32:30 +0300","author":"Miss Beau Hackett"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-117.4687,"lat":36.33931},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1-775-482-7680","vacancy":false,"free_parking":false,"price":"$79 to $149","address":null,"description":"Located just inside the west entrance, this resort is the most economical lodging option.

The three of us stayed in a one bedroom unit and didn't feel crowded. My sister and I shared the bed (which was comfortable and plenty big enough) and my brother slept on the hide-a-bed. Everything was clean, we didn't notice anything unusual or badly constructed in our room, and the staff was quite friendly (except one guy that we only saw once right before we left). Didn't have any problems with the elevators, and never saw the staff in them. We heard a little bit of construction noise once or twice during the day, but nothing serious. There was a full-length mirror in the bedroom in addition to the one over the sink in the bathroom (other reviews complained about lack of mirrors - perhaps this was in a studio room?). Also had no problems connecting to the internet from our room. The only real complaints we had were with the water temperature in the shower, and the shower set up in our room. The temperature rarely got above barely warm (although it was not ice cold), and only once or twice did it get anything close to hot. Also, we somehow ended up in an \"accessible\" room, and there was no separate shower in the bathroom - there were drains on the floor and the shower head was on the wall - not even a shower curtain! It would have been OK except no one else could be in the bathroom if someone else was showering - modesty aside, you would get soaked from the spray! My sister and I usually share the bathroom and one can use the sink/mirror while the other is showering, but this set-up slowed us down when we were trying to get ready and out the door for the day. We liked the neighborhood - it was kind of nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of the French Quarter. We also really appreciated having the streetcar right outside the door - saved a lot of money in transportation costs! You do need to be a little patient with the timing of the streetcars (especially late at night) and be prepared to stand when it's crowded. Zara's grocery store (a few blocks away) was the best one we found (more selection than the one St. Charles, which I think was Williams Market). Zara's is not a \"supermarket,\" but had a better selection than the other one if you are planning to do any cooking in your room. There were a few restaurants within walking distance on St. Charles, but we didn't get a chance to try any of them (we mostly ate in the French Quarter). There's also a Walgreens nearby (easy walk for an able-bodied adult). We got a nice little packet from the concierge for a self-guided walking tour of the historic Garden District homes, and this is a great option for the budget-conscious who don't want to pay for a tour. Note that only one home is open for indoor tours, and it's only open on Mondays (New Orleans Opera Women's Guild Home on Prytania St, $7 pp). Lafayette Cemetery is within walking distance and seemed perfectly safe during daylight hours (it closes at 2:30 pm). We rode the streetcar to the end of the line toward the Upper Garden District/Uptown neighborhoods, and if you go at a time of day that's not crowded so you can sit down, it was a great way to see the architecture - we thought many of the homes we saw were more impressive than the ones near the hotel that get so much attention. We took a walk in the residential area at the end of the line and saw some really cool houses. Highly recommend booking Charles Ritz Enterprises for transportation to/from the airport - same price as a cab but his vehicle is much nicer/cleaner. We were running late on our way back to the airport (and it was at the start of rush hour), but he knew the shortcuts and still got us to the airport in just over 30 minutes. Also: Our mother is a Worldmark owner, and in other Worldmark stays we've been pressured to attend a presentation, but that didn't happen here.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Rooms":4,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2014-07-12 01:52:12 +0300","author":"Felton Witting Jr."}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-117.1467,"lat":36.60624},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":null,"vacancy":false,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":null,"description":"Motel-style lodging in Stovepipe Wells.

The bathrooms have been upgraded and are quite nice. The rooms have a kitchen that helps you save money, if you are inclined to cook. The first room I was given had a nonworking air conditioner but I was quickly changed to a room with everything functioning properly. The only thing I didn't like about this hotel was that the hallways were dated and kind of dismal. The Avenue Plaza is a timeshare but also rents rooms to non-time share people. The cost for three nights was $500. The hotel is located in the Garden District, away from the activity in the French Quarter. This made for a quieter stay but made touring the French Quarter more difficult. The St. Charles Ave. trolley stops in front of the hotel but you must be prepared for the walk from Canal St. into the Quarter. If you plan to go to the French Market, it is a bit of a walk to get there. I paid $60 something for valet parking at the hotel and then drove my car to the Quarter so I wouldn't have to walk so far. I had to pay $13 for parking each day in the lot along the river on Decatur St. I took the trolley one night because I was eating dinner near Canal St. and it was more convenient than driving. The Avenue Plaza is convenient to the zoo and good restaurants in the Garden District. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you are ok with not staying in the French Quarter. The staff is extremely helpful and kind.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":4,"Location":3,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2014-03-24 09:21:47 +0300","author":"Tia Stracke II"},{"content":"We stayed here using a family members time share allotment. It was wonderful! We were hoping for one of the larger rooms with a couple beds as there were 5 adults, but we ended up getting a studio with one king. Three of us slept in the king and we brought a blow up matress. (we were prepared) All the roll away beds were being used but they gladly brought us up more sheets and blankets for our blow up. The king bed was very comfy. Parking is extra, but I must admit having to not worry about parking, walking to the car, and safety was really nice. Just call down before you leave and valet will bring your car around. They did seem to be a little understaffed as the guys doing valet were also bell hopping which delayed our check out. We eventually just went down to get the luggage carrier and brough all our bags down ourselves. It wasn't so bad, but they kept telling us someone was coming and they hadnt. The room was very nice. There was a small table and chairs, the kitchen seemed fine but we only used the fridge and toaster mainly. At the end we put everything we used in the dishwasher (soap provided). The bathroom was updated and you could def tell. The show was soooo great! It had a large shower head that poured straight down and also had the option to switch to a smaller head that was detachable. The toilet seat was uncomforable and too small for the toilet. We complained upon check out and were told they were aware and working on it. Apparently it was some big fiasco when they remodeled?? The pool and hot tub was a little small, but had a nice patio surrounding. The gym was huge and well equipped. We loved the location of the hotel. It was right down St Charles street which is close enough but far enough from the action. We never took the trolley but it was right there if needed. It was very popular and we saw many people took advantage. The hotel is connected to a resteraunt but they were closed during our stay. Nextdoor though is a small place called Igors which is a bar, grill, laundromat, and game room. We went there one evening and the drinks and atmosphere was very nice. I really have no true complaints about anything.

The front desk said that housekeeping did not find any shoes. Yeah, right! To make the stay less inviting, housekeeping staff yelled at each other down the hallway as they cleaned at 8:00am each morning. It made it rather difficult to sleep to say the least.

Compared to the great ambience downstairs, I was kind of disappointed by how spartan the guest rooms were. The bed was a fine size for me (5'8), but my 6'4 companion was uncomfortable in it. Be advised that the rooms do have a serious \"old house\" odor, but it adds to the character of the place. The staff was helpful and friendly, but the service was very no frills.

Also online found a code for free breakfast and used that in the reservation, so it pays to check the hotel's website! Had checked other reviews here and knew what to do: use the self park rather than more expensive valet, and carry your own bags to avoid the wait. As others noted, you have to use two elevators to get from street to room, but no big deal. The street outside is ugly and has run-down buildings for sure, but did not in any way feel unsafe to me. Two blocks from downtown crossing shopping, two blocks from the Boston common, right next to chinatown, so we actually thought it was a good location for getting around. Inside, the hotel was great looking, room was large for a city hotel, service was all good, and the buffet breakfast was awesome, especially if you can get it free! We also used the pool every day, and the kids loved it!

Why only one, we don't know, but when it came time to get the bill for breakfast we were charged $21.00 for the buffet. Apparently that's what they charge per person. Now I am not cheap, but given what was offered in the buffet, we thought the price was exorbitant. No carving or omelet station or anything like that.

The hotel interior was very nice and the staff friendly and helpful. Our room wasn't ready at check-in at 5:00 PM, but they gave us a complimentary drink and appetizer and called on the cell phone when the room was ready a short time later. What was disappointing was the exterior and the area around it. To get to the street was circuitous and then you had to go back upstairs (carrying wheeled luggage), so awkward on checking out and meeting my car service. The area around it was fairly seedy and dark on a street way off the mainstream, so a bit uncomfortable at night. The weakness of the staff is that they weren't particularly helpful in providing advice about nearby restaurants, so didn't travel too far in the dark. The next morning, discovered nice restaurants nearby and that we were only a few blocks away from Boston Commons and the theater district.

We opted for a Red Level room to enjoy the amenities without much expense: the food and all the drinks are included, all day long in the Level lounge which we enjoyed. This hotel has one of the best restaurants in Barcelona, Dos Cielos. Not to be missed! Although the hotel is not in the center of town, it is just a few euros away by taxi.

Firstly (although nothing to do with the hotel) Girona airport is not in Barcelona..! anyone expecting a short taxi to the city maybe shocked when the driver tells you its 120 euros ! Girona is actually around 100 km north of Barcelona ! Best bet is a taxi to Girona train station (15-20 euros), train to Barcelona-Passige de Gracia (20 euros), yellow metro from Passige de Gracia to Poblenou (1.45 euros each). All in all takes about an 1hr 20mins and the hotels about 10 mins walk north of Poblenou metro station. Anyway, the hotel is in a district called 22@ which is a nice area to the west of Barcelona city centre. This turned out to be a real plus as we felt we saw more of Barca than we would have had we stayed in the city centre. The area felt safe and clean and had a few good restaurants and cafes for lunch or breakfast. The best way into town from the hotel is via metro, Poblenou station has the yellow line which goes via all the best spots in barca. We particularly liked Port de Olympica and Barceloneta best at night, and all the touristy stuff in the day (la ramblas, passiege de gracia for shopping, parc guell and sagrada familia cathedral etc). The hotel is a 29 story high rise building and is quite striking from the ground. when we arrved the lady on reception was really friendly and helped us with directions and gave us some recomendations etc. we actually ended up agreeing with pretty much everything she said! The hotel It has a roof top pool on the 6th flr with a bar, sunbeds and little booths to sleep and relax in. word of warning, the cocktails will blow your head off and cost about 10 euros each!! we didnt use the restaurants although we heard they were supposed to be good. All in all this hotel is a really good choice, we had an amazing time and although its a little out of town we actually found this to be a real positive! Lastly - if you decide to use the \"love me tender\" pack they provide..FYI - ITS NOT COMPLIMENTRY, ITS ACTUALLY 30 euroes !!!!!!! total rip off for whats inside (trust me)..","ratings":{"Overall":4},"date":"2013-07-25 06:18:51 +0300","author":"Sophie Moore"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-117.14634,"lat":36.60545},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":null,"vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":"$12 per night","address":null,"description":"(Closed in summer).

A great excuse to travel at any time but now having had the \"ME experience\" we are saving the pennies (or cents) at a furious rate so we can head back as soon as possible. The hotel is located just off Avenguda Diagonal, not so far from the \"Gherkin\" building and was easily reached by airport bus transfer and short taxi ride. First impressions at reception were very good indeed. It is a boutique style hotel and the mood is nicely understated - not pretentious but very welcoming. After a speedy check - in we were shown to our rooms on the 23 rd floor. We were very fortunate to be able to have booked a suite and nothing at all disappointed, from the spectacular views of the city to the high quality furnishings and extras provided. All the electronics are Sony, Philips etc. and the bathroom complimentaries are all high quality brands. The hotel provides just about everything in the room for your stay as standard and anything else is just a phone call to reception away. Our rooms also meant that we had access to the \"Level\". This is a lounge on the 25 th floor where guests can avail themselves of complimentary beer, wine, spirits and light snacks which are refreshed throughout the day. It's a great place to meet for breakfast or for drinks before you venture out into the city. The hotel restaurant has recently been awarded it's first Michelin star and we met the chef on a tour of the hotel. He took great pleasure in showing us his kitchens which were prepping up for that evenings sittings. And that also sums up the whole attitude of the staff at this hotel.

No bath - sure the hotel is funcky but a nice bath after a day out is really nice 4. Agree with previous reviewer regarding the light/curtain swithes that can be confusing. I'm in IT and it took me a while to work it out. The curtain slider in our room was out of order. 5. Lighting in the room not suitable for getting any work done. Some people are lucky to go on a work trip or vacation without having to work at night, well I had to and it was very taxing on the eyes. 6.

There was no lamp on the desk and the lamp over the sofa didn't work .Also my reading lamp (on my side of the bed ) didn't work .The lighting therefore was very poor for anyone who would like to work or write or read . The only bearable spot to do all that was just ONE SIDE OF THE BED .Beside all this , (and the most annoying ) every time the shower in the room just over our own was used , water was running inside our OWN shower from the ceiling . Shall I mention that TV didn't work ? ( we didn't care about this that much though) .We mentioned the lamps and the shower problem to the concierge ( all of them are very friendly and speak very good english ) and as a result somebody knocked our door once and mentioned the lamps but at that particular time I was resting and couldn't receive him .No second attempt was made after that apparently . To the positive side I will mention that due to a party that would have taken place during our last night at the hotel we were offered a level room (20th floor )to avoid the inconvenience of the noise, where all lamps were working at least and you wouldn't have to fret if your unknown upper level neighbor would think to take his/her shower at the same time as you.

We booked on Last Minute.com so got a cheaper price than normal room rates however it was still more expensive than other hotels closer to the city centre. We were wanting a bit of luxury for a week and thought Barcelona was ideal for a part relaxing beach/sun holiday and part city break. We only booked this hotel because it had a pool and a 5* rating. We arrived at the hotel and the check-in queue was enormous so we had a relaxing drink in the comfortable bar area. To be fair check in was quick once we got the front of the queue but the entire foyer area smelt a bit wierd. The place is trying too hard to be cool with dubious colour choices for furnishings and steel walls??!!! Our room was ok the bed very comfortable and we got a good nights sleep (we were woken every morning by the maids at about 9am though). The bathroom had no extractor ran that we could find and after a shower the condensation ran down the glass panel separating the room from the bathroom and left dirty marks on the window ledge. I wouldn't say the room was spotless but it was adequate. This hotel was in quite a poor location - ok so fairly close to the nearest tube station (10 mins walk) and tram stop (5 mins) but a way out of the city. Cabs in barcelona are fairly cheap though so this isn't really a massive issue. The worst part about our stay was that on our last day we were enjoying the sun in the pool area when we were asked to leave due to there being a private party in the area. There was no pre warning or notification of this and we had to get up and tramp down to the beach via the tube to enjoy our last day of sun (I am 5 months pregnant with twins so was hoping for a relaxing day!!!!!!!!)

We were here for a business convention and on first look, the hotel and the rooms look great - until you try to utilise them. The hotel is a taxi ride to any tourist areas of Barcelona or a 30 min walk. There is a decent area about 8 mins walk for restaurants but this is NOT a city centre hotel. The rooms are attempting to be model and minimalist but end up being unfunctional and uncomfortable. Here's my room issues: 1. No kettle/coffee maker in the room. Virtually unheard of in a hotel of it's \"class\". 2. Cement floor in room, slippery when wet and cold. Carpets, wood, whatever ... not this cheap alternative. 3. Chair at desk is not a work station chair but a cheap, \"trendy\" plastic design - not good. 4. Impossible to shower without getting the bathroom floor drenched. 5. The wrap around curtain on 2 walls ... whose idea was this? Only one wall is window but the curtain covers both and is VERY slow on it's automatic open/close. Furthermore, it didn't close all the way and left a 3 inch gap for the light to stream in at 6am. 6. There is a control panel for all the lights and AC. Each button pressed done something different, each time. Everybody I spoke to had this problem. 7 Outrageously priced mini-bar and room service (18Euro for a hamburger) and as your miles from anyway, it's a good weight loss hotel! Beds were good, TV was ok, other bathroom facilities good - and their maid service is some of the best I've seen. Other problems. Bar staff are worthless. People waiting to be served, while 2 of them stocked and cleaned, 1 served - very slowly. 5euro for a 330ml glass of tap beer is twice the price of anywhere we drank. Outside the elevators on every floor smelled of toilets - probably because the rooms toilets backed onto that area. Poor ventilation? Breakfast is a very generous 11am finish except at weekends when it's even better at 12noon. Arriving at 11.05 on a Saturday, we were told it was finished. Questioning why, \"because we have to set up for a lunch meeting in this room\". Even though we told her the note in the room said 12, when we checked in we were told 12 - she said there is nothing she could do, even though we could see a full buffet breakfast table and people eating. It was only after demanding a manager that another staff member made a call and let us in - it should not have came to this. Smokers - forget it if it rains, there is no area even remotely or partially covered outside! Overall, this hotel just failed. It has a few good points but it's not comfortable, doesn't provide you a feeling of luxury or a level of relaxation and just feels a bit like they don't know what they're doing.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":3,"Value":1,"Rooms":2,"Location":1,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":2},"date":"2012-03-29 11:12:46 +0300","author":"Abdullah Lubowitz"},{"content":"We were booked into the ME for 9 nights, we checked out after 3, staff were very unfriendly and unhelpfull. the rooms are among the smallest Ive ever stayed in.

Arrived in Madrid at 10pm and had to wait 50 mins for the shuttle bus. Rang the hotel only to be told it was nearly there - but it wasn't. Arrived at hotel eventually and queued to check in. The surly receptionist asked to see my daughters passport and told us that as she was 13 (it was her bithday the day before) we would have to pay for her to be in our room. When we booked we were not told this so refused to pay. After much messing around she reluctantly agreed to waiver the charge but was obviously not happy. By this time there was a large queue behind us so it was all a bit embarissing to say the least. Eventually got to the 'suite' and it was horrid. Basic with paper thin walls, it just looked awful. The kitchen didnt have a single plate, cup, or glass - whats the point in having a kitchen ! Bedroom was small with a teeny window and the most vile bed I have slept on in a while. Limp and lumply pillow which didnt smell very clean and the bedding consisted of a sheet and a horrid manky looking blanket with a thin and unattractive cover on top. My daughters bed was shoved up a corner in the lounge and was equally horrrid. Would have complained but by this time we only had about 5 hours to get some sleep so decided to get on with it. However next doors TV could be heard through the walls and ny husband and I were constanly itching - maybe the blankets?? Ended up hardly sleeping. I am not a constant complainer, if you look at my other reviews you will see that but I would say only go to this hotel if there are no other options, we hated it and it spoilt the end of our holiday. Only paid 60 euro but dont think it was even worth that.

The hotel is located in a quiet residential area on the outskirts of the city- a perfect location for relaxing, sunbathing and taking nice walks! We arrived at 2pm when the shuttle wasnt operating- but it was only 15 euros including the airport supplement which isnt bad at all! Just make sure you have the hotel address or a little map of its location printed out as the taxi driver hadnt heard of it- but found it with his sat nav! The hotel is lovely, very clean and definately of 4 star standard! Our room was impressive, the air con worked perfectly and there was an English tv channel. The beds were sooo comfortable and soft! All the staff were very helpful- the staff at reception printed off maps for us to walk to the nearby shopping mall which was only 10 minute walk away. The bar and restaurant staff were also lovely and very helpful. The pool area was great! The pool was bigger than it looks in the photos- about 10m long and has 4 sunbeds and plenty of room to lay your towel down to sunbathe. There is also a lovely garden area just next to the pool with comfy chairs to lounge on while having a drink or a snack. The metro station is about 5 minute walk away up the street and it costs 1 euro 50 to get to the city centre, the metro was clean and very easy to use! There is also 2 little shops close by to buy water/ drinks/ snacks/ ice creams and there is a cheap Chinese restaurant right accross the street. There is a shopping mall about 10-15 minute walk away with loads of shops including H&M, Zara, Primark and also has restaurants and fast food such as Burger King and McDonalds. Ive seen that people have commented that you have to pay for internet- if you check the computers sometimes theres time still left on the counter and so me and my boyfriend found we were able to use the net for free quite a few times! :) I would definately recommend the Maydrit as somewhere that is calm and tranquil compared to the busy city- however the city is only 20 mins away by Metro to pop in and out! I had a lovely long weekend sunbathing and relaxing and would go back anytime!","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2014-09-12 14:43:31 +0300","author":"Colby Nolan"},{"content":"Stayed 4 nights in October 2010.

About EUR20 by taxi from the airport. Write down the address beforehand as most taxis do not know where it is. 5 minute walk to the Metro. El Capricho station is about 20 minutes ride to the centre of town. Breakfast was good and thorough. Dinner menu limited but the cuttlefish entre was divine and the steak was very good also. I believe there are a couple of restaurants nearby but I did not try them. The front desk staff and at least one in the restaurant spoke english fairly well. No gym unfortunately but a park is 5 minutes away if you need to go for a walk/run. There was a pool but being autumn it was covered so I did not try it.

Don't think the following: \"If i call or email the airport to confirm the airport shuttle (as promised on expedia) that it will ensure that I get a shuttle\" We did this and even though they told us just to call when we arrived (we gave them our flight time and everything)., when we did arrive they said we would have to wait 4 hours to get picked up and that there shuttle only ran in the morning and evening. They told us this even though we confirmed out flight time (in std. and 24-hour time). And, as it turns out, there are days the shuttle doesn't even run, so just because you arrive in the morning/evening doesn't guarentee you the service. if you do get stuck, it is VERY easy to take the metro - it just takes some time because there's no direct line and you have to go south and then back north on the train. The customer service people at the airport metro stop were extremely helpful. They even printed us a map! Also, the hotel is located steps from a metro which made it convenient to go downtown for the night, before flying out the next day. the only reason we chose this hotel was because we wanted our last day of our one-month trip to be hassle-free. screw that.

We rented one of the rooms and another couple who had a small child stayed in the 2nd room. My husband and I stayed here for three nights in August 2010 and paid 50 euro per night. LOCATION: Great location, a 10 minute walk from the train station, 5 minute walk to a metro stop, 20 minute walk to the Colosseum. The street it's located on is pretty quiet at night. There is also a cheap internet place down the street and a few cafes for a light breakfast. ROOM: The room was very spacious, there was a king size bed and a twin for just the two of us. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The room was clean when we arrived but it wasn't cleaned daily as stated in the room description. We did get fresh towels daily, though. I didn't like having the bathroom separate from the bedroom, but it was only for our use, so it wasn't too bad. BREAKFAST: The breakfast was very meager, no cereal, yogurt, biscuits and cake as described. We did have bread and jam and powdered coffee and hot chocolate was available. MANAGER: The manager was pretty nice when we arrived, but she doesn't speak English. I tried to make it work with my limited Italian. The batteries on our air conditioning remote control stopped working and instead of finding new batteries, she told us we would just have to share the remote control with the people staying in the other room. The morning we were leaving, the manager came at 9 am and she couldn't get in to the apartment with her key for some reason. When I let her in, she was annoyed with me and I'm not sure but I think she said that I had locked the bottom lock of the door (which I hadn't done). It was very strange. She went to clean the room of the people in the other room who had checked out earlier and then my husband and I went to get some coffee down the street before leaving. When I told her this, I could tell she was annoyed, probably because she wanted us to check out so she could leave. But check-out was not until 10, so I didn't care. OVERALL: The Domus Diana is pretty nice and convenient, but the last morning left a bad taste in my mouth with the manager getting annoyed with me for no reason. I would consider coming back because of the cheap price, and great location.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":2,"Value":4,"Rooms":3,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":3,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2014-10-28 17:22:53 +0300","author":"Wilber Ferry"},{"content":"It was safe, super-clean, quiet, astonishingly close to the train station, and very reasonably priced.

First thing I did after booking was read the reviews on Trip Advisor. Of course you get some good & some bad so I was open minded to find out for myself...Big Mistake!!! I'm a very easy spirited person & not a picky bone in my body, besides we only needed a place to sleep. The place didn't look bad when we pulled up (My younger Sis & Mother), neither did the front counter. The only thing noticed was the super strong smell of Chlorine in the dirty pool (as per my mother) but we weren't planning on swimming so no big deal. The guy (Amid?) can't remember his name, was very courteous. He asked us to wait one moment while he went to check the room. He came back & handed us the key. I felt all was well. However, as soon as you opened the door (Room 108) you immediately smelled the mold. As you walked in the room, you could see it EVERYWHERE!!! No joke. We turned around & told Amid we couldn't stay in that room. My chest as well as my Sister's was hurting from breathing in that strong odor. He told us he had one more room upstairs (Room 224) so we took the key & gave it another try. No mold but it smelled of Alcohol and urine (as my mother put it) and the bathroom pure urine. The smell was Horrible. At this point we were DONE!!! We went back and told him we are leaving. He apologized and gave us a cancellation # but said we would have to call to get our refund. It was late (close to 11pm) so he offered us the room for free stating that we would not be able to find a room anywhere else for the night. We declined! Not even for FREE!!! That's how Terrible the rooms were. We drove a few minutes down the street & stayed at Orlando Vista Hotel. What a BIG difference with less than $25 more per night. My advice: Spend the extra $ to ensure your safety as well as your health. A good night's sleep is priceless...in our case, just a few dollars more.

It was supposed to be \"Superior King Bed Room\" with a refrigerator and microwave. There was no refrigerator or microwave when we arrived. The very nice front desk clerk told us we could put anything we wanted into the refrigerator in the office. Who would put food in refrigerator that they couldn't see? GROSS. The smell in the room was SO BAD that after an hour in the room, I became physically ill. The entire carpet was wet, which is probably where the smell was coming from. We were moved into a room with double beds, which was uncomfortable for my husband and I. The smell in that room was barely tolerable, but I fell asleep with a wet rag over my face because it was so late that we didn't think we would be able to find another hotel. The next morning, I asked for a refund for the price difference between the room we stayed in and the room I had PAID for ($10 for the refrigerator/microwave and $10 for the room). The best the manager would do was a 10% discount, which wasn't even close to the price difference in the rooms. We even had to jump through hoops for that small amount.

It was our first trip to Florida. The initial part of our stay was quite comfortable. The room was tidy and the rooms were acceptable. We were quite surprised at the size of the pool (it was quite small) and did not appear heated. One night that we were staying there, the alarm went off and we never did understand what had happened. Other than that, the hotel itself was fine. One incident saw them coming to our room to deal with the toilet being plugged and them accusing us of having put disposal women's pads down there, even though my wife had no such need nor did we do such a thing. Unfortunately, the clearest memory of the stay was upon checking out when we were advised that we would be charged for \"ironing burns to the carpet\". We were actually scolded at not using iron boards which were available to the rooms, yet there were no postings seen of such availabilities (we had ironed our clothes over blankets laid out on the floor). Although we had not seen any damages to the carpet, the staff became insistent that they were there and, quite frankly, made us very uncomfortable at the tones of their voices. They charged us $20.00 for the supposed burns, which we did not argue and paid, and we were off. We have been back to Kissimmee a few times since, but have never since considered staying at the Sevilla Inn. I am still not sure if the burns were actually there, but giving them the benfit of the doubt, our biggest complaint was with the manner in which they treated us.

The rooms take one back in time to the original styles and designs of the 1800's. A real connection to local residents, the 905 is a regular tour stop and the oldest hotel in the French Quarter. My wife and I prefer to stay in the first floor rooms where there is a sitting room with TV, bedroom, bath and kitchen. The kitchen has a stove and refrigerator, sink, coffeemaker, etc. Plus there is a streetside private entrance (very good security system) and a covered balcony area with seating so you can watch passersby. Quaint, cozy, and most of all: ORIGINAL. No plastic remods. Feels like my great Grandmother's place. While there are more luxurious places to stay, if you want the real flavor and eclectic style of N.O. you have to stay here. It just FEELS like New Orleans. The location is one block towards the river from Bourbon Street and smack dab in the middle of everything. Royal street is one of the nicest residential streets in the Quarter and you can walk back to your room and get some peace and quiet whenever you like. The French Quarter is always busy so we bring a small fan to turn on to make some white noise so we can sleep more soundly. Works great. You might not need it at the 905 but it's a necessity it if you stay on or near Bourbon Street, which is very loud all the time. Parking tips: You can park right in front to unload and it's only a couple blocks to the secure riverfront parking area. Plus there are several public parking lots nearby. My strategy is to get there early, unload, and drive around for a while near the hotel. It's not too hard to find a parking place but be careful about where it is. Stay away from corner spots since streets are narrow and delivery trucks don't have the room to turn and they will hit your car. Take note of the signs. Tuesday and Thursday they clean the streets and you can't park in many areas when they do or they will tow your car. Once you find a spot don't move it since everything is walking distance. If you find a good spot and get a ticket it will cost $20, which is cheaper than the daily rate at most parking garages. Even if you don't get a ticket make sure to go online to N.O. traffic ticket site to check your license number for violations. Some local kids think it's funny to take your ticket and throw it away since the fine doubles every month it's not paid. You don't know you got a ticket but your fine is getting bigger. We've been coming to the French Quarter for years and have stayed at many of the local hotels. The 905 Royal is our favorite.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2013-12-05 09:27:07 +0300","author":"Delmer Cole"},{"content":"I stayed there with a friend for a girls trip around St. Patricks Day.

The basic hotel room was small, and the shower had no door. The closet was also small. As opposed to a few other reviews, I found the staff to be friendly enough. The floor below the top floor lounge was noisy. The bass of the speakers reverberated through the ceiling. This wouldnt have been so bad, but they dont even let you in to the bar! (They say guests are allowed in before 9 pm, but who the $@!#% wants to go to a bar in the Meatpacking District before 9 pm?? What a joke.) Another thing that's odd: the hotel straddles the High Line, but it has no access to the High Line. You have to walk south a few blocks to get to it. Odd. There's nothing wrong with the hotel itself, really. But at the Ganesvoort they let you up to their popular bar and pool if you stay at the hotel. Most hotels try to make their guests feel \"exclusive\". The Standard manages to do the opposite.

We arrived a little early but were able to check in and they even upgraded us (without our even asking). The room was amazing - views of the Hudson River and down to the Statue of Liberty. The room had a wrap-around banquette across from the bed which was a nice touch. The TV was mounted to the floor right in front of the windows which was odd since it blocked part of the view. The bath was split on either side of the room as you walked in, with the shower/bath tub on one side (with a great louvered window to see the view) and the sink and toilet on the other side. I understand set up design-wise but it wasn't all that practical since the sink area was very small and the shower area had no door so water ran onto the carpet. We went to the lounge at the top of the hotel for a drink and snacks before the theatre (love the elevator art installation). It was retro-fun with a wonderful view (take your sunglasses). It was nice but a little chaotic - it felt like they didn't have the seating plan down yet. It is set up like a lounge so the tables were jumbled and and the wait staff kept pushing us to one side or the other trying to decide what table we were sitting at. Service was anything but invisible which was distracting. The menu was limited but nice. We had never stayed in the Meatpacking district before so weren't sure what to expect. We were really interested in seeing the HIgh Line and this was a great way to experience it. The park is beautiful - they did a phenomenal job on the design and details. The whole area was packed with shops and restaurants and had a really good energy.

I recommend that they do not advertise the Wireless Internet until they have their service together. I attended WorkShops during the day and planned to work back at my motel at night. The service frequently cut off Internet Access and I got messages that the Broadband Link was broken, which I did page capture of the \"Broken Link\" message. I tried to use the Internet early in the morning, with the same result. On my last night's stay, I contacted the front desk and the person on desk suggested that I pull my chair out of the room and sit under the router to get a stronger signal. I did this because I needed to work but of course this did not increase my access. They also suggested that I take my computer to the office. So, I hauled my laptop down to the little lobby (where they said I was only allowed to go) and with the same result--no Internet Access. I was told that there may be Internet Cafes up the street. However, I do not know Chicago well and I did not have a car because we carpooled. However, I was willing to go and find a Cafe but I tried to call out on the hotel phone first to see what Internet Cafes might be open and available and only got a busy signal.

As a former resident of the city, I can say the location, while not ideal for getting downtown, is very good, especially if you enjoy the neighbourhoods of Chicago, rather than the downtown core. Andersonville is within walking distance, which is a great neighbourhood. Also, the Clark bus (#22) is one block away and this bus will zoom you down to Wrigleyville/Lakeview/Lincoln Park quite easily, or even downtown.

If you are looking for a gay, cruizy, safe, clean and affordable place to stay in Hollywood, this is the place.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2012-02-24 17:19:41 +0300","author":"Ken Koepp"},{"content":"A very old hotel, very private with two stories of rooms around a central courtyard with pool, and above ground spa. I was looking for budget accommodations and $69 a night fit the bill. The room had a king bed, comfortable, small refrigerator, nice size shower (water fluctuated in temperature), and a small bathroom. It was all I needed, and the room was very clean, even thought it was very old in style (think 1950's The Honeymooers decor). Guys walk around with towels around their waist (ala bathhouse), and at night many leave their doors open for fresh air, ETC. It was quiet, yet cruizy. I got a good nights sleep, once I got to bed, and slept well. Coffee (all day) and donuts/croissants in the morning. The spa was very warm. It was October so i didn't try the pool. Dry sauna was old, large, but very cozy. One gay channel on TV 24 hours. The front desk guys were very friendly. The doors from the lobby to the rooms is secured (they buzz you in), and any guests you may have visit are charged $10 and must show picture ID at the desk before they are allowed in to the rooms. I will stay again; i liked the atmosphere, friendly desk people, \"eye candy,\" and the comfortable bed. If you don't mind old, enjoy a cruizy gay environment, you might want to try this place.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":3,"Value":4,"Rooms":2,"Cleanliness":3},"date":"2015-05-04 06:26:19 +0300","author":"Judge Boyle"},{"content":"We were not originally booked to stay in this hotel but due to electrical issues at Casa Martini Hotel we were transferred here for one night (both hotels have the same owner). The hotel is in a typical Venetian house and area. It was not difficult to find, the area (Cannaregio) was very safe and lively with good shops and restaurants as well as the only McDonalds in Venice nearby (if that's your thing). Our room was nicely furnished but not as luxurious as it seems on the web site (it photographs deceivingly well). We had an in room safe with an outlet for a notebook computer but the outlet did not work. The TV was nice but had no English channels (same at Casa Martini). Not a big deal. The bed is two single beds pushed together, pretty typical for a European hotel. My one complaint about the room was that it was not well cleaned. The floors were dirty, as well as table surfaces. Bathroom was adequate but had that annoying shower head that does not set into the wall so had to be held the entire time. Two towels and two hand towels were provided but no bath mat or face cloths. Water pressure and temperature were fine. Our room overlooked the street below as well as the private courtyard of one of the superior rooms. Air conditioning worked great and windows were large and bright. The hotel itself has a small interior courtyard which was plain and had filing cabinets and other miscellaneous materials stored in it (not very luxurious looking). The room where breakfast was served was comfortable. Breakfast was hot drinks, juices (dispensed), cereal, croissants, biscuits, cured meat, sliced cheese, yogurt, canned pineapple, dates, etc. Unfortunately when we arrived for breakfast (8:30 am) there were no clean dishes left so we had to eat our food on napkins. Breakfast should have been better organized. We had a similar problem at Casa Martini - except that there were no dishes left and no food left at 9 am. Staff were fine to deal with (don't except anything too friendly, this is Europe after all, and that's part of the charm!) Spoke fairly good English. Keys had to be left in a bowl at reception but this is fairly normal for European hotels and we found it to be fine. There is no 24 hour reception at this hotel so you must buzz at the front door to gain access after reception hours. Again, fairly normal. Overall, using trendy furnishings and a nice web site does not make a hotel luxurious. This hotel is probably not worth the price (in high season). If you're going to stay in Venice do it right - its a beautiful city and where you stay does impact your overall impression of your vacation in the end. If you are looking for an average hotel this one is fine.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":3,"Value":2,"Cleanliness":1,"Sleep Quality":2},"date":"2013-11-15 15:56:45 +0300","author":"Orion Moen"},{"content":"We were very impressed with this \"boutique\" style hotel.

The hotel staff was great and was very friendly. We enjoyed being downtown Napa and being within walking distance to many resturants. When we arrived we asked the councierge for recommendations and she gave us an envelope full of tickets for free tastings around downtown and deals on dinners or apps at various resturants.

The rooms are spacious, well appointed and modern. The mattresses and pillows are soft, very comfortable for those who prefer that. The oversized soaking tubs are great when paired with a room upgraded with fireplace. The door to the bathroom slides closed and therefore is not much privacy. A couple of complaints about the large open shower, the overhead rain shower is a nice plus but it cannot be operated at the same time as the regular directional shower head. Additionally, on a Saturday morning around 9 to 10 am, there was no hot water. There is a restaurant in the lobby, but we experienced poor service, and extremely overpriced food. Our party of 4 waited 45minutes for food, while the waitress kept apologizing but doing nothing to help. Overpriced because for 2, 2 egg breakfasts with 2 lattes was $50. While opting for convience we were actually delayed, gobbled our food in a rush, and made late to our appointment with Far Niente. Overall, great hotel, but avoid the restaurant. Many great restaurants around the area. Also, an issue with noise late night noise from terrace with firepit on the 2nd floor, which is great for casual gatherings. The 2nd floor rooms facing the terrace can hear and see everything, there needs to be a reasonable closing time for its use. At midnight, we heard a very inebriated group of people shouting on the terrace for about 45 minutes.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":3,"Value":4,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2015-11-21 01:54:20 +0300","author":"Orlo Batz"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lon":-116.39006,"lat":34.0726},"free_breakfast":false,"email":null,"phone":null,"vacancy":false,"free_parking":true,"price":"$15 per night","address":null,"description":"Located in the northwest corner of the park, this campground is not accessible from the main park roads.  100 sites, water and flush toilets available."}

Everyone was extremely kind and helpful, and the concierge helped provided us with tips and passes for free tastings at the wine salons downtown. Mostly everything was within walking distance, which was ideal for us as we didn't want to deal with driving or paying for a shuttle. I cannot say enough about the beautiful room. The swivel TV was a perk- you could adjust it to watch from pretty much everywhere in the room (including the bathtub). The only slight downfalls were the view from our room (walls from both windows) and excessive noise during early hours (many bottles clanking together around 5 AM and construction/drilling noise).

A definite departure from some of the \"teddy bear and lace\" experiences from previous trips, the AVIA Napa starts and ends with you feeling as if you were a long-lost member of the family, home for a short visit. The rooms are comfortable and inviting. Appointed with luxurious linens that covered one of the most comfortable beds that we have ever slept in. The bathrooms are bright and spacious with plenty of room for two. Our room had a lovely soaking tub and a large flat screen television. The restaurant only serves breakfast and lunch, which works out fine since most people are out wine tasting or shopping during the day.

We were not disappointed! We stayed five nights. The hotel is located in Kowloon, just a few blocks from the Tsim Sha Tsui metro station, the waterfront and the Avenue of the Stars, Kowloon Park, and plenty of shopping. It's in the middle of a vibrant neighborhood with lots of authentic noodle shops, delicious street stand food, restaurants/bars, and modern convenience stores. The hotel is modern and bright and although the rooms are small, they are very comfortable with flat screen TVs and a good selection of English channels, a fridge, microwave, safe, free Wi-Fi, and a hair dryer. It had all the amenities you need. The bed was comfortable and I was most happy that the room was very quiet despite the street noise below. We had a room on the 12th Floor and I recommend a high floor to ensure that you are high enough to avoid noise. The staff was helpful and polite and provided a good city map upon arrival. I couldn't get the Wi-Fi working on my phone initially but the hotel staff quickly helped resolve the issue. Although the hotel does not have breakfast, there is a great option half a block down the road called, DeliFrance. They had good bread, croissants, muffins, as well as, eggs and ham. Their set breakfast meals are an excellent deal, being about US$3-5 each, including coffee. Overall, we had a great experience.

There are many small roads that can lead to the hotel from Nathan Road. Personally I prefer to use Humphrey.. If you come from Granville Road then you have to turn right into Carnavon Road, pass Cameron Road on the left and Prat Avenue is the next road. The hotel is located on the right hand side of the road on Prat Avenue. Look out for \" Neway \" signage at the top and you will be able to spot the hotel.

We had again booked a Club level room and got an ok room with a nice view to the pools and to the nightly fireworks of Disneys. The room was very average and a bit small for an adult and two pre-teens, but it worked out fine. The bathroom/ closet door combination is though a bit strange and not very practical. The premises are average in style but the pool activities just great for this clientele. It was the climbing wall that won the votes of my sons, but unfortunately with quite destricted opening hours never had a chance to use it. They were not open in the morning and closed before returning from the days activities, pitty. Anyway, the pool slides and grotto, bicycles etc provided some fun for the kids. The service at the pool is almost nonexistent, a big minus. The Club here had nothing to do with my previous hotel in Key Biscayne, and therefore was a quite disappointment. A small club with inconvenient opening hours and very limited servings did not impress. Additionally, the alcoholic drinks had an extra charge. The breakfast was correct for our needs, so that worked out well. Extra plus for a very helpful Club Consierge, who gave us so many tips for the parks and shopping. As said, the hotel is very conveniently located by 15 minute drive from Disney and Universal, two major shoppings, and only 5 minutes away from a Outlet Mall. In the area, there are plenty of restaurants to feed the children for their taste (Subway :-). Last evening we dined at the hotelÂ´s Hemingway restaurant, and it was really worth it. The food was great and the athmosphere quite nice. We had to rush out though, since the children had heard about \"smors\" session at the \"beach\" and it was about to end in half an hour. Well, this turned out to be fire made so that you could prepare your marshmellows, but after buying the kit from the bar, we had no glue what to do! Good thing there was one parent who was able to give us the instructions. In general, we had a great stay in Orlando and the hotel worked out well, but as said they could put some more emphasis on their guests. Thanks to a one previous tripadvisor posting, I was alert about the summer package charging, and guess what, they had charged me four nights instead of three. The receptionist though credited me without problems.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":3,"Value":3,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":3},"date":"2013-03-22 14:07:42 +0300","author":"Tyree Beahan V"},{"content":"I had an extra day in Orlando and planned to stay in a \"normal\" hotel in Orlando.

The free shuttles are pretty decent but we found going to universal from 9am to 6PM was just a bit too long for us, took a taxi home instead. Tips: We ordered take out to be delivered from a local establishment. They wouldn't let the people in to the resort. We had to take a shuttle to the front gate, by then my phone was exploding with calls from the delivery man. Don't take the town car they provide, it will cost you an arm and a leg.

Compared to the quality of the hotels in Orlando, this would be at the higher end, without question. The rooms are lovely, and the cleanliness of the hotel itself is excellent. Location wise, it's not walking distance to International drive, and is only accessible by taxi or car. This basically means that if you don't hire a car, you will have to depend on the shuttle services provided by the hotel, which not all parks and attractions are provided for free. As a typical example, we had tickets for the Wet & Wild park, but had to pay $38 for two adults to get us there, which only took 15 minutes. The part is actually across the road from Universal Studios, and if we had known, would have ordered the free shuttle service from the hotel instead. So although paying the $25 daily hotel service free, free travel only applied to some of the parks. Another matter which greatly annoyed us is that complimentary breakfast was included in our package, which included tax and 15% gratuity, which we had in writing from the hotel. Despite this, we were on one occasion in the middle of eating, when one of the waiters rudely interruped to mention \"I know you have a voucher for the buffet breakfast, which means I get nothing, and indicated that we should leave him a tip\". Neadless to say, we refused to sit in his breakfast seating area, and it left quite a bad taste taste in our mouths after that bad experience. We feel strongly that the $25 daily hotel service fee should be part of the hotel cost, which isn't cheap. We feel that a hotel should as policy, let you use their facilities; pool, gym, use their towels etc as this is what the minimum requirement of providing a satisfactory service without having the charge their customers for the previledge. I have stayed in many hotels worldwide, and have never came across this charging policy before. 'Mears' the taxi company the hotel use, were quite aggressive about tips. Although they appear rather overly friendly initially, if you don't tip them, expect quite a nasty reaction! All in all, not a bad hotel. Location isn't perfect, if I was booking again, I would look for a hotel in the north nearer the main theme parks. They also need to rethink the hotel service charge. We walked away with an additional mandatory $250 bill upon checkout just for staying in the hotel, and it does make you think you are being charged just for staying there using facilities you believe you have already paid for when you book your room. So if you are going to stay in the Hyatt, you will need to budget for this additional expense. It's not a hotel that we are likely to return to, to be honest, and I would advise to shop around and use trip advisor.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":3,"Value":3,"Rooms":5,"Location":3,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2013-02-19 06:22:50 +0300","author":"Zachery O'Connell"},{"content":"Newly renovated rooms are great.

We didn't select the all inclusive option, but did eat at the restaurants on site, and were blown away at the quality of the food. The service was fair - if you have travelled in PR, you'll be familiar with this. The rooms were great. They were large, and had either a balcony or a terrace. Each room had a fridge and a huge shower! One of the best parts was the fact that they had Aveda bath and hair products! The pools and hot tubs are a great way to stay cool. The beach is not that great, but if you have a car, take a drive and explore local beaches - you won't be disappointed. Our favourite part of Copamarina was it's direct access to Gilligan's Island!!! For $7US/person, Copamarina had a private shuttle (pontoon boat) to take you to Gilligan's Island. Gilligan's is a nature reserve in the middle of the bay. It has shallow warm water, and you swim through the mangrove to the open water. It is a fantastic experience, and you cannot travel to Guanica without going. We loved it so much, we went twice on the same week! Be prepared to take absolutely everything you'll need for the day. From food, to beverages, to chairs/towels etc. There are picnic shelter and grills - if it's a PR holiday, it will be packed, so book as soon as main reception opens.

My husband and I currently live in the US but were going to visit family in Puerto Rico. As part of our trip we decided to go and have a few days in the south coast in Guanica with our 6 month old son. Before we went I told my husband that I grew up going to this resort and that it was quite lovely and tropical. When we got there it was not the hotel of my childhood. Our room was full of mold, spider webs, not cleaned thoroughly and the A/C was not working. The first (and only) night our A/C woke us up in the middle of the night making banging noises. The next day we requested for the A/C to be fixed. They immediately came and \"fixed\" it. In the middle of the day when our baby was taking a nap the A/C started to smoke. After we stopped the A/C, I told my husband that we could not stay. Our baby had gotten diarrhea and allergies from the mold and dust in the room, the A/C was blowing smoke, and the room was moldy and not really clean. We instantly decided to leave and informed the front desk. They told us that they would charge us for the remainder of the day and night, but we did not care. At no point during checkout did they ask why we would leave late in the afternoon, if there was something wrong, or if there was something making us leave. I apologize for the long story, but I had to share my unfortunate experience in Copamarina.

If you are looking for stuff to do late at night, you will not find it here: this is a place for relaxing. The beach in front of the hotel itself is mucky, as it is adjacent to a mangrove swamp. At times the smell of the swamp gets to the hotel. On the other hand we got to see some of the amazing birds, no doubt due to the proximity of the mangrove. A short walk away is CaÃ±a Gorda Beach which is nice, and the hotel has a private shuttle boat to beautiful \"Gilligans's Island\" (Cayo Aurora, officially). Gilligan's can get very crowded on weekends, beware- get there early. We have stayed several times at this hotel: the service has been outstanding and the facilities impeccable always. The all-inclusive package is worth every penny. The one time we did have a problem with our bathroom somebody from the hotel staff was there to check it in less than 5 mins, and when they couldn't fix it they changed us to an equivalent room, all within 30 mins... on New Year's Day. You can also take a short drive to some of the outstanding beaches to the east (like Tamarindo). And the adjacent dry forest is definitely worth exploring - with the necessary precautions: the heat can be suffocating even in the early morning, some of the smaller trails are poorly marked, and you must keep an eye out for mountain bikers.

It has a central location with easy access from the airport and to Old San Juan. It is also only a 3 block walk to Ocean Park Beach. Perfectly clean -- and I am a clean freak. One of the staff here said it was renovated 2 years ago when purchased by Hilton. All of the staff is super friendly. The pool area is nice with comfy towels and lounge chairs along with a jacuzzi. The hotel is in a heavily populated area so things are pretty compact and there is not much of a view due to the tall buildings all around. They have done a good job of putting palm trees, etc around to make it feel less \"citi-fied.\" There are many restaurants within walking distance so no need to drive around. We enjoyed \"Silk\" --they serve sushi, and chinese cuisine. Parking is a bit much at $20/day valet or $15 self-park, but comes with the terrifory.

Never met a more friendly and helpful hotel staff. Although our upgraded rom wasn't quite ready when we arrived we were given some water and the famous warm cookies and we sat outside for a few minutes in the delightful surroundings of the pool. The room was great, everything you need and very modern. The supermarket across the road was a bonus for buying toiletries etc., to take on the cruise. We walked around the corner to Bebo's Cafe which was full of friendly locals(always a good sign) and we enjoyed an excellant, reasonable meal and a half pitcher of Sangria. We then headed back to the hotel and had a drink under the stars around the pool along with other people who were using the pool or just sitting around. Only thing that could be improved is that the service at breakfast was a bit slow, but we were on holiday so that didn't realy matter. And an added bonus was that we got to meet the charming and very handsome Jose (operations manager) who told us all about his island of Peurto Rico which he obviously loves. Thanks to everyone at the Doubletree.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2015-08-11 14:45:24 +0300","author":"Octavia Olson"},{"content":"This is by far the nicest and least expensive hotel in the Cantado area.

The newly renovated rooms are very clean and wonderfully appointed (w/ fridge and microwave), our breakfasts at Michaels and Under the Trees (both on the property) were on point and reasonably priced, and most importantly, the hospitality of the staff (especially Yodil, Peter, and Miguel) was comforting and delightful. It's approx a 3 block walk to the more quiet \"locals\" beach and 4-5 to the main strip of resorts and casinos. For us it was not worth the $300-450 more to stay on the typical resorty main strip (note that most \"resorts\" on the strip seemed older and much less contemporary than this hotel). Pool was small but clean and while families were there, it was certainly not overrun with kids like others. Ask for Yodil Caban, the General Manager, and he will make sure that your stay is outstanding. These folks don't just talk the customer service game, they live it. As they told us, the smaller size of the hotel allows them to be more personally attentive. It's a $0.75 bus ride to Old San Juan or a quick $12 cab ride at night (note that cabs are more expensive at night so it was probably cheaper during the day). If you're in Old San Juan and want a great dinner in a posh, elegant space, check out Marmalade. Expect at least $40-50 per person, but the chef clearly knows and loves great cuisine (note: this is not local Puerto Rican food, but delish nonetheless).

On the positive side, most of the staff is friendly and will go the extra mile but two of the receptionists could do with more training on how to greet/deal with customers and the waiter who served us the first (and only) time we ate at the restaurant could gain on honesty. In term of location, I understand it is a great place for surfers as it is close to many spots but that's it. Although many other interresting places (suggested in their handbook) are from reachable distance if you have your own transportation and are planning to do some sightseeing. On the other side, as we tour the hotel on our first day there, we realised (from the view from the restaurant) that it appeared to be still in construction ... however other bits tended to prove that it was either old or badly maintained. A case in point is \"the whale\" a small slide for kids in the pool area. The paint on it is totally faded and in some area the steel even shows. Another review mentionned the plumbing system, and I thought come on, that was until I realised I could hear my neighboor shower, flush their loo ... and that the pressure of the water in the shower also changed if my neighbour was having a shower at the same time. The fact that I could hear all this was a good indication of the soundproofing as well ... paper thin walls and doors and noisy a/c made my nights there virtually sleepless. Oh nearly forgot ... what they say about the critters in and outside the pool is true too ... in the shower next to the pool we were greeted by a cosy spider (in full swing in its wide web) and a dead cocroach and inside the pool ... an unidentified amphibian. I stayed in Puerto Rico for 10 days and I went to three different hotels, this one was the worst ... and for that price, I will not recommend it to any one I know!!!","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":2,"Value":1,"Rooms":1,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":1,"Sleep Quality":1},"date":"2013-03-08 21:31:27 +0300","author":"Davonte Botsford"},{"content":"The view is without a doubt breathtaking.

The \"tongue\" of the whale at the pool is literally black, the stairs leading to the pool are covered with a green moss like $@!#% (slippery) and the pool itself is dirty and full of leaves. The lobby area is very dirty, the floors very dusty. No elevators, and the stairs handrails very rusty and sticky. None of the staff has a uniform, their wear anything they want, any color, any style, and the housekeepers are wearing nurse uniforms. Very unprofessional.

Loved it so much that we have had a REALLY hard time adjusting to home again and we can't wait to come back soon. As far as the Embassy Suites: Pros:1. The room is a suite. Anyone with small children knows this is important. We could put the kids down for bed or nap and still be in our living room talking and that was great. 2. They serve free breakfast every morning and than we only needed a small lunch or snack before dinner. 3. They have a managers reception at night with snacks, juices, pop, and drinks. We stopped here every night before we left the hotel for dinner. It was a great before dinner appetizer that helped hold all of us over before our later dinner. 4. The beach was beautiful during the week. The Embassy Suites section was nice and it was great to have chairs, towels and umbrellas at the beach. 5. The pool, although crowded, was nice and perfect for the kids to play in for hours while I could read a book. Cons: 1. It's not that clean people. We have traveled to a lot of Embassy Suites and this one is by far the dirtiest one we've stayed at. At first glance the rooms look clean, but then you start looking in the corners, at the carpet, under any furniture, closer at the fixtures in the bathroom and you can tell that these rooms haven't been deep cleaned in a LONG time. Gross 2. One the weekend it was crazy crowded. We had to wait 20 minutes in the breakfast line, and same for managers reception. It was hard to find seats and could barely find anywhere around the pool. That thing that was the worst was the cleanliness at the meals during the busy weekend. For example, the bacon tray had more bacon hanging outside on the counter than in the actual tray. I looked at my husband and said is that supposed to be decoration or something? It was gross and wouldn't pass food codes for sure. I understand that they are busy on the weekends but then that shouldn't surprise them, and they should bring in more staff to handle the bigger crowds. 3. The front desk staff were not great. They were friendly, but always talking to other co-workers and I felt bad interrupting them. I would go down there and ask for towels to be delivered to the room, it never happened. 4. We pre-paid for our trip on the embassy website and it said it covers all taxes and fees. They racked on more than $300 worth of taxes before we checked out. I went to the counter and showed them my receipts and they weren't willing to budge at all. So frustrating when you prepay for things. If they have a \"special tax\" then they should add that in when you prepay. Overall we again LOVED PR, an amazing island with great culture and even better Puerto Rican food. I highly recommend going to see El Morro fort, the El Yunque rain forest, going to Luquillo beach and check out all the food stands, and our favorite going to Old San Juan and spend the day there. As for the Embassy Suites, I wouldn't be that excited to stay there again. It worked for us mainly because we were traveling with small children but I would not be that excited to stay there again. Honestly I would stay somewhere closer to Old San Juan...","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":3,"Value":3,"Rooms":3,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":2,"Sleep Quality":3},"date":"2014-01-27 07:53:20 +0300","author":"Elaina Morissette"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lon":-118.256879,"lat":34.041494},"free_breakfast":false,"email":"enquire.dtla@acehotel.com","phone":"+1 213 623-3233","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":"From $199","address":"929 S Broadway","description":"Opened early 2014 in the historic United Artists building that was built in 1927 for what was then a maverick film studio.

Hotel is in a good location (close to airport and cruise terminal) but there is no shuttle bus to either, meaning $20+ taxi rides are compulsory with many drivers adding extra charges for large parties and baggage. Our room was described as a 2 bedroom suite, but was actually a living area with sofa bed and a bedroom with two small double beds. Having a party of 5, a 2 bedroom suite would have been more than suitable, but the doubles weren't big enough for two people to sleep comfortably meaning 2 of us were made to sleep on the VERY uncomfortable sofa bed (so uncomfortable in fact that we ended up taking the cushions off the sofa's and sleeping on them on the floor for 3 nights, something you don't want after 23 hours of travelling.) There were not enough towels, cups, tea/coffee or pillows and it took three calls and a visit to reception for them to provide us with these. When we asked about the beds we were told that we would not receive help due to booking through HOTELS.COM. The bathroom has no natural light so is very dark due to the lack of artificial lighting also. Our room was 623 opposite the elevators, something that made it noisy at night. Can't complain about breakfast, acceptable especially seen as it was free! There was plenty of loungers at the pool but the pool itself was dirty and cold. Laundry facilities were good. Don't recommend the Outback Steakhouse. Our server was rude and incompetent and lost our debit card! She was never around to assist us and the food was very disappointing. Have stayed at many budget hotels that have been more pleasant that this, a hotel that claims to be part of the Hilton group. Being a Hilton Honours member I am very disappointed with this stay and won't be returning due to the reasons above.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":2,"Value":2,"Rooms":1,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":3,"Sleep Quality":1},"date":"2014-06-06 22:24:06 +0300","author":"Adonis Friesen MD"},{"content":"I used my chase visa card only once in puerto rico, to pay for my embassy suites hotel bill in December 2011. 3 months later (last week), an individual in PR began spending $1000/day on the card until visa canceled the card.

As another reviewer mentioned, there is no hotel shuttle (there don't actually seem to be such things for any of the properties), and a taxi will cost around $12-15. Parking at the hotel is chaotic--there was never a problem getting a space, but it seemed like we were constantly behind drivers who couldn't work the gate and then insisted on going the wrong way upon entering the garage (it wasn't just us -- we noticed the garage staff seemed a bit bewildered by this behavior, too). Parking, at $16 a day for self park, is less than I've paid at other hotels in the area. I stayed there with my parents between Christmas and New Year's, at the height of the busy season. The hotel was a bit overrun with college swimming teams in town for winter break training, and the fact that the hotel was bursting at the seams showed quite a bit: the line at breakfast and at the manager's reception / happy hour in the afternoon were both incredibly long (forty five minutes for the latter). The first day we were there, the staff seemed to be overwhelmed; by the time we left, systems seemed to be in place to deal with the madness. The hotel is not on the beach - the beach is about a ten minute walk away up a side street. There is a section of Isla Verde beach reserved for guests at the Embassy Suites (look for the flag), where a staff member will provide you with beach chair, towel, and umbrella. Restaurants in the hotel are a bit pricey--we ate at the bar the first night because we arrived late, and the prices were on par with a restaurant in Old San Juan, even if the service and quality was not. There's an Outback Steakhouse in the hotel, which is one of the most expensive places in Isla Verde to eat -- ask at the front desk (not at the concierge stand -- the concierge is a private company) for recommendations for local restaurants within walking distance. There's a Pueblo grocery store next door for basic provisions.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":3,"Value":3,"Rooms":3,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":3},"date":"2015-06-27 13:25:35 +0300","author":"Nils Lowe"},{"content":"we loved this place, beautiful grounds, great pool, happy hour, gym, fantastic breakfast. a real surprise as we had been delayed in san juan for a day and were not sure what to expect..","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2014-04-01 00:44:28 +0300","author":"Otho Mann"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-118.256982,"lat":34.050233},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1 213 892-8080","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":"$99+","address":"550 S Flower St","description":"Trendy hotel with designer rooms and a bar and swimming pool on the roof.

Since my sis and I have never been to PR we had no \"real\" idea about location but this was the Best, especially if you are not renting a car. and wanting to do outdoor adventures and seeing Old San Juan. The bus ride was longer than a cab but only 75 cents is right up my alley!

He was courteous and efficient in setting us up with our 2nd choice cocktails. We did check out the casino but did not gamble. it was loud and yes you can hear it from your living room but as others have said, the bedroom was quiet. I must express that the beds were fantastic! having a bad back and sleeping on a theraputic mattress at home, I was worried without need. The bed and pillows were so comfortable that my sleep was never affected! The room was clean with plenty of towels. I do wish they would put regular blankets in the closet for covering up on the couch though. The complimentary breakfast was superb! The staff friendly and quick.

It was very close to the airport, so very convenient, but it was quite quiet. No plane noise. The hotel boasts a multistory atrium and is well appointed. There is a daily happy hour with free beer, wine, and chips which is very nice for a quick snack and a full included breakfast everyday with omelettes, eggs, bacon and much more! The rooms were spacious and as the title says are all suites, with both a bedroom, living room with foldout couch, microwave and refridge. The beds were very comfortable and the room updated and clean with good housekeeping. The pool area was quite nice and although very near an overpass was nicely screened by trees and vegitation. The pool was quite cold, and unfortunately the hot tub was broken for 3 of 5 days. I found the staff behind the desk not quite as welcoming as I'm used to. They were unhelpful in assisting with a printer which would not print in the business center, however the business center was free! $19 per day for parking is a bit high as well. The hotel is a block or two from a very nice beach and has included free towels and beach chairs for hotel guests! There are numerous nice restaurants and inexpensive options as well within walking distance. The hotel and airport are about 20 mins from the fort and the old town area, so a car, bus, or taxi will be necessary to visit these areas. Just for new years, we decided not to do the $89 per person buffet and partied in our room, but the open balconies and atrium allowed us to enjoy the confetti, live music and festivities from a commanding view of the 2nd floor open balcony and atrium. And much new years revelrie was occurring on all the hotel balconies, so was the best of both worlds! The rooms were remarkably well insulated, I think helped by the extra space of the living area, because even though we turned in before the festivies were over downstairs, I did not hear any extra noise! There is a casino inside as well which I did not visit.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":3,"Value":4,"Rooms":5,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-03-08 12:30:39 +0300","author":"Joaquin Kutch"},{"content":"Close the beaches, restaurants, clubs. Nice Hotel, but Puerto Rico was the real selling point. Had to walk about 2 blocks to get to the beach, but its is incredible. The hotel staff are just amazing and the hotel quality is good, clean and in good shape. No balcony and no exceptional view, but you don't need that. The pool was nice, happy hour was good, the breakfast was incredible. A little pricey, though. Great experience, never seen so many good looking women!

We arrived early in the morning. Melvin at the front desk was wonderful. He directed us to the buffet breakfast with cooks also preparing made to order requests. The breakfast was hot with lots of variety to choose from. The staff was prompt in meeting guests needs while keeping supplies stocked. We then did some gambling in the on site casino and before we knew it our room was ready. When we arrived at the room it was fresh and clean with a big bathroom, coffee maker and mini-refrigerator. There was a nice grocery store and pharmacy within short walking distance. We enjoyed the bartenders at the complimentary happy hour. They were very friendly. The hotel is a brief walk to the beach, however, we enjoyed the pool so much that we never found the need to go to the beech. When I had a problem with my cell phone, Christina at the front desk was very helpful in locating a sprint store nearby. Nice hotel and staff.

Arrived in SJU around 1:30; but didnt go directly to the hotel because I knew check in wasnt until 4pm. Rented a car from SJU and we went directly to Plaza Las Americas to check that out. Got to the Embassy Suites around 5pm. Check in was a breeze. I asked for a room overlooking the SJU runway and they quickly accomodated. The suite was very nice. There were 2 beds for the kids and I slept on the pull out couch. Although, when I woke up the next morning I began to itch from what I can only think were some type of bugs. The kids didnt complain of itching so I was okay and decided I could live with it. Anyway, back to check-in on the first day, we went directly to the pool and relaxed. The next morning, Sunday May 16th, my birthday, I woke up to a note under my door that there was a 5.8 tremblor in the zone of Mayaguex which is about 120 miles west of San Juan. It occured about 1am however I didnt feel it. It woke my son up. I didnt notice any items had shifted. But, what a bang to start a birthday. Anyway, back to the hotel. The breakfast buffet is everything other reviewers have said. They cook omlets to order. Plus, there is bacon, sausage, potatoes, corn beef hash, pancakes, french toast, fruits, cereal, juice, coffee, hot chocolate, et al. The atrium area on the weekend had vendors that were showing their wares(sp). There was even a man who was making pottery with a clay machine. It reminded me of Demi Moore in \"Ghost\". The nice part of that was that he would let the kids try their hand at pottery making. The only downside was Carolina experienced some torrential downpours that flooded the streets and consequently affected the roof and subsequently the pipes which caused some problems. Specifically, there was no water coming out of the shower. I called the front desk and they told me it would be rectified in \"10 minutes\" Maintenance came to my room twice. All told it took approximately 90 minutes. The maintenance man was so apologetic that there was no way I could hold onto my disgust. We did experience the opportunity to eat at the Outback Steakhouse on the property and the staff was great. To be honest, the food alright. The kids loved it though. Since it was my birthday, they sang happy birthday to me in both english and spanish. Another night I got pizza for the kids from the Atrium Cafe. They didnt have any complaints. Because there are so many fast food places nearby, like Church's Chicken, Ponderosa, Burger King, Chilis, et al, everyone should be able to dine on what they want and be happy. I came to Puerto Rico for my 50th birthday and a vacation. Lastly, to have a relaxing good time. And I did. Lastly, the Manager Reception was wonderful.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":3},"date":"2013-03-20 02:54:32 +0300","author":"Willy Price"},{"content":"Things that I didn't see in other T.A. reviews: (1) There are two pools, an adult pool, and a very shallow kids pool, really more of a toddler pool. (2) The pools aren't heated, and can be quite cold on relatively chilly days. (3) We traveled with two little ones and a nanny, and the suite was adequate size for us. (4) Besides the Outback Steakhouse there is a Noble Romans with (yucky but edible) pizza, hot dogs, and coffee downstairs. (5) Room overlooking the atrium can be noisy, but not all rooms overlook the atrium, so ask for one that doesn't. You might still, however, have a lot of street noise. (6) The free booze at night attracts a rather white-trashy crowd. I'd much prefer if they had less alchohol and some real appetizers, instead of stale chips. (7) Among the restaurants in easy walking distance are Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC, Church's, Subway, Burger King, a Chinese place, a Puerto Rican place (great food, crappy service), Wendy's, and more. The front desk won't tell you about any of these places unless you ask. (8) Don't rent a car to go to Old San Juan, parking is a huge hassle. But if you are going anywhere else, it's likely going to be cheaper to get a car on Hotwire than to take taxis. (9) The area by the kids pool is right by the highway, plus there was a lot of construction noise, not so pleasant. (10) Get to the buffet before 9 if you don't want a huge line. All in all, we had a nice but not fantastic stay. I give the hotel slightly more than 3.5 stars based on value, but I'm sure there are much nicer hotels in San Juan, on the beach, with heated pools, less noisy, and so forth. But traveling with 3 adults, this hotel saved us from having to get two rooms, and we all got a nice free breakfast, so the tradeoff was worth it.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":3,"Value":5,"Rooms":3,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2014-06-03 17:33:38 +0300","author":"Danial Schiller"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lon":-118.250337,"lat":34.052677},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1 213 617-3300","vacancy":true,"free_parking":true,"price":null,"address":"251 S Olive St","description":"The OJ jury was sequestered here.

They are courteous and go out of their way to make your stay to your liking. That being said, I must say that the room quality is becoming an issue. We stayed there last year and at that time I thought the rooms needed some upgrading. They are not lighted properly, very dim in front room area. The sofa sleepers on both of these trips were not worthy to be slept on. We had another couple with us and they said they were just horrible as far as comfort.

They gave us directions to Espana Bakery on Calle Marginal Villamar. This bakery is awesome! Only 5 minute drive from the hotel and they had everything from pastries to sandwiches to quiches to hot meals and even liquor. Delicious! We went there the day we were leaving and picked up sandwiches to eat on the airplane. The other passengers were jealous! Down sides - they do not have an airport shuttle. The front desk said that they are not allowed to have it??? Small casino - okay for a novice, but not sure if real players would be satisfied. Daily parking fee for guests ($10 / day). You would think they wouldn't charge guests for parking. An added hotel fee of 9% (or something like that). They attribute this to providing free internet access, free local phone service and other services. Just be aware of this. Not sure if other hotels have started charging the same \"fee\", but the Embassy does. Regardless, we got a great package deal through Orbitz. Over all, service was great.

It is about 1/2 mile and 10 minute taxi ride from the San Juan airport. First off I will mention that the hotel is nice and very clean. It has an attractive lobby and pool (you are near the airport but the noise of landing jets really isn't an issue). However this hotel is not without problems. The hotel does offer free internet access (as mentioned on their website) and there are three free interent kiosks near the check in desk. However, at least one of them was always out of order and the other two were constantly being used. My biggest complaint with the hotel is their handling of crowds. As mentioned we stayed there on a Saturday evening and the hotel was extremely crowded. The receptionist informed us that Saturdays are always busy because the \"pre-cruise\" crowd. (Apparently, a good number of customers stay in this hotel one night prior to their sailing date.) While the managers reception and cooked to order breakfast have always been some of the best things about the Embassy Suites we've stayed at - these are poorly handled at this one. First off the manager's reception. This hotel has a rule that there is a 2 drink maximum per bar visit. This is a problem if you have small children and your spouse has to stay with them while you wait in line for the drinks. The bar tender told me that I could come back for additional drinks, but the line was long and the wait was about 20 minutes. Also, the drinks are served in small palstic cups which don't tend to last very long. I think that, with additional bar tenders and a little more efficiency (larger cups??) the wait time could be drastically reduced. The same thing happened at breakfast. Very long lines (especailly if you wanted cooked to order foods). The wait was again about 20 minutes and finding a place to eat was a challenge. Finally, we asked for late check out on Sunday morning. Being an Hilton Honors member I've never been denied this request. However, this time I was. After having to prod for a reason why this request wasn't honored, the management finally told me that they had another large group checking in and needed to get all of the rooms ready. They did offer to store my luggage but we needed to do laundry so that wasn't much help. We tend to stay at Embassy Suites when we travel. While I might go back to this one, it was the most disappointing of all of the Embassy Suites properties that we've stayed at.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":2,"Value":3,"Rooms":4,"Cleanliness":4},"date":"2013-01-07 19:02:05 +0300","author":"Gilda Nolan"},{"content":"My family stayed here on Jan 25, 2005. It's funny reading the previous reviews because we had a very different impression of the hotel. I found it to be clean, comfortable and quiet. Yes, there is maintenance being done, but the workers are very careful and warn you if you are approaching a freshly painted area. The beds are fine, the sofa bed is a bit uncomfortable and for one night was acceptable. The breakfasts were fine. Great coffee. The nightly manager party was fun with fruity drinks, and standard junk food of chips, pretzels, party mix and popcorn. The pool was lovely, I can't figure out what people were complaining about. I didn't see any missing tiles and I made a point of searching it out. One traveler said the pool area looked like a hurricane hit it. I can't figure that out either it was simply beautiful. Yes, you can hear the planes either taking off or landing depending on the direction of the wind. After awhile you get use to the sound and you don't notice the aircraft noise. The sounds of the kids screaming and yelling drown the noise out. I don't mind the sound of the kids, I simply put on my headphones and listen to music. It's not as bad as previous reviews write and I consider myself very sensitive to unnecessary noise. The beach is exactly 3 blocks away. One long block and two short. If you have very young kids, this might pose a logistical problem because you need to carry your towels/junk and hold onto kids. I have kids 14, 12,9, so it was no problem. Yes,one of the streets is a highly trafficed street and there is no traffic light. But if you enter the crosswalk the cars did stop for us. No, I wouldn't let the kids do this by themselves. I just don't trust them or the drivers. We walked to the beach and went banana boating which can be found in front of the ESJ hotel. At the same time other kids are on the beach and my kids made instant friends. This worked out well for us. The beach is public and you can rent the chairs for $3-$4 per chair depending where you stop. In front of the ESJ hotel the chairs are $3. This place is good for a short stay and the hotel is designed for business travelers. As we saw mostly flight attendants and business people. If you like the hustle and bustle of San Juan this a decent place. If you are looking for a peaceful surrounding and limited night life you should stay a resort such as the Hyatt in Dorado. The hotel staff is very accomodating and helpful.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":4,"Cleanliness":4},"date":"2012-02-05 08:14:00 +0300","author":"Ms. Alec Cassin"},{"content":"I stayed at the Embassy suites with my family. I was overall satisfied with our stay there. The staff was very helpful and the room was kept clean. Initially I was put off by the fact that our room had lots of ANTS. The staff was quick to move us to a different suite when we complained about the infestation. So I wasn't a happy camper when we first arrived. I also couldn't believe that a suite which would sleep 4 of us only had 4 drawers and a tiny closet. The drawers were small. But you know what? by the evening of our first day there we forgot all about that other stuff and enjoyed the managers reception-which is free drinks and snacks. The hotel is also conveniently located off the main road which has many souvenir shops,restaurants and a small supermarket. The best place to get puerto rican food inexpensively is La Casita which is in the shopping center near the hotel. I've also stayed at the Intercontinental hotel in the past. These two hotels are 2 that I would recomment. The advantage the Intercontinental Hotel has is that it is right on the beach.

First of all, the entrance looks like a cheap entrance of a motel, the facilities overall are ok. The pool was clean and refreshing, but the pool bar wasn't open until 6pm and the restaurant too! The restaurant opens just two times during the day: for expensive breakfast (8am) and dinner (6pm). THE ROOM WAS HORRIFYING! Stains everywhere, small tv with poor signal and 8 channels maximum, no decoration at all, uncomfortable mattress, flat pillows, awful bathroom, Hot water! But there's no way to control it so be prepared for a nice burn. DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OFFERS OF THE WEBSITE! they supposedly include breakfast and dinner but all they give you is a $10 coupon and you'll be notified at the restaurant about that scam.

On th arrival it was slight longish, as check in procedure took a really long time. In fact, i think this was the longest hotel check in i ever had. We had a large room that had a big bed, so it was pretty comfy. Tv functioned ok with good choice of programmes, room was cleand & cleaned every day. Bathroom was little bit sloppy, but still ok. It was clean, but it kind of, needs some refreshment.... Breakfast we had was ok only for first day, already second day you don't know what to take because there is literally only few things displayed... A toast, jelly, butter, some cereals, 3 types of fruit, coffee, milk and juice... Not quite good, isn't it? And thing that really bothered me was the fact that 2 girls \"working\" there ate sandwiches with ham and chese during breakfast time, while guests had their empty toasts. Jummy..... Pool area was not too attractive, right next to reception, everyone on the reception can see you plus there are always some locals swimming, which we didnt like too much. Hotel location was good, close to airport (but far enough), bars, shops and beach which we used few times... Parking in the hotel is not free, but as special guest you have a special price, which was fair. Old SJU is some 15 minutes away (by car), which is ok. If you need/ some evening walks, disregard some previous comments about security in hotel's area, cause it is actually very safe. On the other hand, if you act unsafe, there isn't a place on the earth which is safe enough for you.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":4,"Value":3,"Rooms":3,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":3,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2012-11-03 16:33:18 +0300","author":"Earl Marks"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lon":-118.266793,"lat":34.045581},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1 213 743-8800","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":"$450+","address":"900 W Olympic Blvd","description":"This high-rise hotel is one of the newest in downtown, with stunning views from the upper floors.

We were disappointed as soon as we checked in and saw our room. It was on the lobby floor which may not have been terrible except for the fact that the room was tiny, you could hear everything that was happening outside of the room and worst of all, there were no windows! It was a dark little dungeon. But for the fact that we were only staying 3 nights, I was very close to walking down the street and finding something else. We did ask to change rooms but the staff stated that everything was booked. The staff, by the way, could have been a bit more customer service oriented. They seemed to have attitudes and were not receptive to questions. The service in the hotel restaurant was terrible. The waitstaff were friendly but the service was beyond slow. They don't acknowledge you when you walk in, you have to just guess that you should pick any seat available. The tables were still dirty from prior customers and on one occasion, we waited approx. 30 minutes before anyone even came over to take our order. It was so bad that we complained to the restaurant manager and we weren't the only ones complaining. On the good side, the pool was nice and the beach is conveniently right across the street. The hotel is nicely situated on a relatively busy strip but having visited Old San Juan, I would have rather stayed nearer to there because they seemed to have a much wider and nicer selection of restaurants than where we were and our location seemed better suited for spring breakers. The bus stop to Old San Juan is across the street from the hotel and is approx. 45 mins, it costs about 50 cents. El Yunque is a must see and I would recommend renting a car a driving there as it's a relatively easy drive and was much cheaper than a tour. Our one day car rental was $27 and the visitors center at El Yunque charges about $3.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":1,"Value":1,"Rooms":2,"Cleanliness":2},"date":"2012-04-18 06:39:37 +0300","author":"Toby Wiza"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-118.255828,"lat":34.052913},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1 213 624-1000","vacancy":false,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":"404 S Figueroa St","description":"Recognizable from various movies it has appeared in."}

IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURES advertised on the internet. The bar and restaurant were closed the entire time we were there. When we got to our room it was hot and muggy because the a/c had not been turned on as a courtesy and the room reeked of some sort of perfume/disinfectant. The table and chairs on our balcony were covered in mildew. The headboards and frames on our beds were not secured, the pillows were flat, the bed was terribly uncomfortable and we woke up our first morning there with bites on our legs, arms and torso! OMG!... The iron was broken, the ironing board cover was covered in stains and don't even think about asking for extra towels or pillows! They acted as if I were asking for their first born! It was two of us and only one small hand towel. I love my sister but neither of us desired to share the same washcloth. Our room didn't get cleaned until late in the afternoon, and again two people, one washcloth. It was close to the airport so we knew we'd hear airplanes go by... but nothing could have prepared us for what we heard. We could have sworn that the planes literally taking off on the same street! We paid $109 a night, but it was worth every bit of $50 bucks a night.

We had 3 rooms booked. One that slept 6 and the other 2 that were double rooms. The room we originally were given had water stains on the ceiling and a very musky smell. Upon entering the room I went to the bathroom to wash my daughters face and realized there was very little water pressure. By very little I mean a trickle. There was no way someone could bathe (much less 6 people). I immediately went to the desk and explaiend the problem. They seemed aware of it but the gist of our conversation was there was no way it would be fixed before our stay was over. I requested another room and was offered one on the first floor that only had 2 beds in it with the promise of 2 cots. The room was next to the bar and extremely noisy. Under normal circumstances this would not have bothered me but with all the other issues this just added to my displeasure here. I called the owner and complained. She was not in any way apologetic and when I threatened to leave she said they would charge me for the 3 nights. The other two rooms were musky and generally in poor condition. I travel to Puerto Rico about 4-5 times a year and have stayed at many hotels both budget and higher end resorts. I wanted to try this place as the website made it look very decent. Basic accomodations are never a problem for me as long as the hotel is clean and the service is adequate. Here neither is the case.This was, quite possibly, the worst service I have ever received. The front desk staff was rude and unresponsive, the manager was just as bad, and the owner was indifferent. I was embarrassed as I was travelling with people that had never been to the island and they were left with a bad impression of the service provided in hotels. If this is your budget then stay at the Coral Princess in Condado.

Twenty-four hour security parking is available, so be sure to ask at check in. The hotel was in fact old and certainly gave us a view of Ponce during its more glamourous years. However, the rooms were disappointing. The furniture is old, which isn't bad since it is an old hotel, but there are stains on the cushions. I asked for my room to be changed when the bathroom floor did not appear to have been clean, and numerous hairs were found on the bed. The room I was changed to was not much better, but since we were only staying one night, we decided to settle in.

When we arrived at Perichiâ€™s, the first view of the hotel where hanging mattresses that resembled the hanging Gardens of Babylon. We all thought, â€œoh well, they are renovatingâ€� so we didnâ€™t put much thought into it. When we got our keys, accompanied with a generic TV remote, I grabbed our baggage and quickly went to our room to try to get a hot shower after a day of sight seeing. Walking towards the room, I saw that the doors seemed old and rustic; I thought it was part of the ambiance. When I opened the door of the room the hurricane sounding air conditioning was on and the moist/molded/cigarette air embalmed my nostrils with pizzazz. The bed covers had a huge unidentified stain right in the middle of the bed. I quickly took the covers and threw them in the corner of the room. When I do a 360 look around the room, I thought I was in the movie Trainspotting. The walls where stained and cracks where noticeable on the ceiling. When I enter the bathroom there was a blue toilet bowl from the 60â€™s accompanied by a blue sink and blue tub. I have to say that the blue matched perfectly with the blue â€œflower powerâ€� tiles on the wall. I walked back to the room and noticed that they where triangle shaped patterns on the rug. When I took a closer look, I realized that they where hot iron marks. It seems that a several guests left the iron on the floor. After I laughed and told many times to my girlfriend that I was sorry, we laughed and played along with the hotels crack house theme. I went to the front desk to complain about the room and they just stared at me like I was speaking Cantonese. For the record, Iâ€™m from Puerto Rico and my primary language is Spanish. The morning after our arrival we ate breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast was good and I cannot complain about the service. While I was eating, I was looking at the people that where working on the renovation of the hotel. They where spreading a roll of carpet. What was strange is that the carpet seemed old. Then I realized that they where replacing the old carpet with used carpet. Of course, how can you keep a Crack House themed hotel working with new carpet or new appliances. Maybe they just leave the carpet in sea water for days and employ people to intentionally burn the carpets with hot irons just for looks. Overall I have to say that the hotel is a mess, I stayed in the room in the front of the hotel and they seem to be the worst ones in the premises. The staff was nice although the administration keeps the place looking cheap and tasteless. Itâ€™s very sad that on this part of the island there is a limited amount of choices when it comes to hotels or bed&breakfast. My advice is, spend 20 dollars more and stay somewhere else.

For 2011/2012 Christmas & New Years holiday we decided to make it special. We wanted to spend it on the island. We had stayed at the San Juan Beach several years ago when they were under renovations. We took that into consideration and put up with the inconveniences, it was a good stay. So we looked at the web site for 2011 and saw what appeared to be new pictures of completed renovations, and booked a 10 day stay. WOW!! What a shock we got when we arrive to find that the owner(s), shifted the emphasis from customer service to greed. The lobby was beautifully redone although simple. A restaurant El Perurrican) had been added, but you must be into strictly seafood (Not much diversity). The free breakfast that was served during our last stay was done away with. We assumed too make way for much better accommodations. WRONG! When we entered the room what a shock we got to find that it smelled musty, was very dirty and with stained carpets. The bathroom was full of mold, mildew, and rust. All the bathroom fixtures had mold, mildew and rust. The window shades were broken so you had to take them down and roll them by hand. The air conditioner (although it worked) sounded like a freight train all night, so we convinced ourselves that it was the sound of the ocean in our room so that we could sleep. We did have an ocean view room (which we payed extra for) We could not get room service to leave us clean towels, and the sheets were not changed. Only the bed was remade again and again for 10 days with the same sheets. I believe we had bedbugs, because we were itching all night an in the morning we both had bites all over our bodies. (we marked the sheets, to make sure). No coffee machine, NO blow dryer although the blow dryer plate was attached to the wall. On the third day we took a ride on the elevator, and were joined by 4 housekeepers. I am Puerto Rican and speak the language my wife is Irish/Italian and only understands it a little bit. Well these 4 housekeepers were discussing in Spanish, how pissed (Encojona) they were that, tourist would not leave the hotel until noon or after, thus causing them to be delayed in their duties. And that they could not find a room on a higher floor where they could watch TV and rest. At check out they attempted to charge us for 10 days of valet parking at $18 a day knowing full well that we only used the valet parking for 7 days, the valets were very good and pleasant . When we did try to launch a complaint the only person we could find did not appear to care about our problems. One employ did tell us that the new management did not appear interested in pleasing the customers only profit. NEVER AGAIN!! Beautiful Condado area, but book at your own risk.","ratings":{"Overall":1,"Service":1,"Value":2,"Rooms":1,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":1,"Sleep Quality":1},"date":"2015-03-06 21:55:28 +0300","author":"Adolfo Zboncak"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lon":-118.44544,"lat":34.0863},"free_breakfast":false,"email":null,"phone":"+1 310-472-1211","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":"701 Stone Canyon Rd","description":"This picturesque, five-star hotel is a popular destination for weddings, as well as a playground to the affluent."}

The room we got was worse than what you would get at a cheap motel: Dirty and humid carpets , strong mildew smell, old furniture, no safe box, ornamental phone (didnt even work), the so called \"lagoon view\" was actually a view to a piece of lagoon across the street through a very dirty window. Sleep quality was awful. The sheets were humid to the point of being sticky. The noises coming from the street (honks and loud car stereo) made it impossible to sleep unless you used earplugs.

Then, I decided to take a shower and took my first step into a slimy, tub with a black bottom and mildew and mold stains.

Instead, we returned to find the same stench in the beds, and dirty bath. Then, we realized that there was living mold and mildew on the ceiling and walls. See photos attached. We then informed the hotel manger that we would like to check out and would not be staying for the remainder of our visit, but they refused to give us our money back.

When we asked about the Hotel Service Charge we were told it was another tax. In that situation we figured, what can we do? I took a look at the Holiday Inn Express website and their San Juan hotel right down the street (also in Condado) does not have this service fee. We took a look at the HI Express while we were in town and the pool is smaller than the SJB's, but that seemed to be the only drawback. And the SJB's pool got cloudier by the day, as they seemed to not be caring for it at all. We had to switch rooms after the 1st night because our TV didn't work and you couldn't adjust the temperature on the bathroom faucet. Our new room was only marginally better. And there was one day we came back to no room cleaning after being out of the room the entire day (9-5). At that point we just asked for clean towels for our shower when they offered to clean it for us then. The only food available in the hotel was a continental breakfast for a ridiculous $7+tax. The spread wasn't impressive from the looks of it and I could just grab a better breakfast from a local place for much cheaper. All in all, if I went to San Juan again I would NOT stay at the San Juan Beach.

This is a very special place - you wonâ€™t find anything else like it on Culebra. No wonder people return here year after year! This was our first time, but we will be back. When we arrived for a week in February, the place had been undergoing a process of rejuvenation. Everything was newly painted; repairs had been made; things looked fresh and clean. The new resident caretakers welcomed us and made us feel right at home. They were eager to accommodate our needs, and asked for our feedback. The atmosphere was friendly and relaxed. The three cottages on the â€œestateâ€� are spread out on a hillside facing Luis Pena Cay and the mountains of Puerto Rico beyond. It is a beautiful natural setting: quiet and peaceful. The sunsets and starry skies at night are spectacular. Each cottage has three units with (mostly) covered decks facing the water. The units are simple, but clean and adequate for two people. The covered deck is spacious and comfortable, with table, chairs and a charcoal grill. The bed is a standard double, and there is no hot water except in the shower, (which was not a problem for us, but something to be aware of). There are no cooking supplies provided (except coffee filters), but we found plenty of provisions at the local grocery stores and cooked most of our meals, with occasional forays out for dinner. The small freshwater pool down by the beach is a little oasis â€“ a place to relax, read and cool off after a day in the sun and saltwater. Although the beach at Tamarindo is rough coral, and getting into the water at low tide takes some practice (there is one good spot at the north end by the pool), the snorkeling is incredible. Green turtles feed in the eelgrass just off the beach, and a colorful variety of reef fish make their home in the coral. There are several other good snorkeling spots, notably Carlos Rosario, and the wonderful sandy beach at Flamenco, very near by. Tamarindo is not a resort and Culebra is not a resort island. For those like us, who avoid resorts and instead seek simple, unpretentious places to explore, swim, snorkel, walk, read and relax in beauty and tranquility, it was perfect!

We strongly recommend that you visit the various Mayan sites (don't miss Coba), as well as the extraordinary 'Selvatica' zip line tour through the jungle. Make the Allegro Playacar your place to stay on your next vacation.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2012-02-24 07:59:36 +0300","author":"Woodrow Ritchie"},{"content":"we just returned may 02 from a week at this resort and have nothing but positives despite the beginning of press on the h1n1 outbreak.

We were somewhat apprehensive about staying at a resort that was less than 4 1/2 Stars as we had always been warned to avoid these. This was our 4th trip to the Mayan Riviera & we booked 1 week at the Allegro Playacar & 1 week at the Barcelo Maya Colonial. We were quite amazed at the quality of the food, the best we have had at any resort we have ever stayed at. Cudos to the head chef! We only ate at the Buffet however as never had a chance to make it to the a la cartes. (Note: To book the a la cartes you MUST book 1 day in advance). We were not disappointed at all as we were so impressed with the Buffet restaurant. Such variety! Great presentation! The rooms are very basic but we found them to be adequate. TV's are rather antiquated. Though no one goes on a trip like this to sit in your room and watch TV, it would still be nice to be able to get the weather channel. Don't count on it at this resort! Poor reception, bad picture quality and very little channel selection. A dresser would be nice and a FULL shower curtain or shower door would improve matters as well. Yes, the pool water was cold but when we were there they had just had a stretch of cooler weather. As always, it was great once you were in! The pool activities were great and the activities co-ordinators were AWESOME!!! The Beach area is very small but you can walk a long way down passing resort after resort & will eventually come upon open beach. We particularly enjoy walking on the beach and were not disappointed here. We walked 45 minutes in one direction before turning back to head \"home\" and could have gone further. The grounds are beautiful and extremely well maintained. Staff are very friendly and accommodating. More bar service during the daytime would be a good thing. We quite enjoyed the location. It is a 20 min walk to Playa del Carmen in 1 direction & approx a 3 min walk to a fair sized Plaza in the other. This is a very small resort & we found it had a lot more charm than some of the larger resorts we have stayed at.. In summation, would we recommend this resort to others; we already have. Would we stay at this resort again; absolutely! Would we return to the Barcelo; not likely.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Value":5,"Rooms":2,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":2,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2015-05-29 21:28:23 +0300","author":"Mr. Syble Leannon"},{"content":"We had the best experience at the Allegro Playacar. The hotel has little huts and each hut has 4 rooms. The rooms are smaller but big enough to live in and really how much time do you spend in a room? You have your own patio with table and chairs and a hammock!!! It is clean and the staff are great. I left small tips $2/day... each day and they give you ten star treatment.There was one night where a man was way too drunk; he fell and his head was bleeding, the staff came quickly and took care of him with dignity and respect. The food was awesome with lots of variety. It's hot and very tastey for some who are watching there calorie intake and for someone who isn't!!! I felt very safe.We brought four children with us and I let them do what they wanted because I felt so safe. I would stay there in a heart beat again and again. You are close to a little market; one block to the left, the bank and starbucks. Also you can go to Playa de Carmen (5 minutes away) and to Cozumel; a 30 minute ferrry ride from playa de carmen (great place to shop and snorkel!!!). Do the Mayan Village/ cenote /Chichen Itza tour with George and Noltours; a five star tour.You can stilll climb this pyramid, one of the last few. Bring little gifts (from your culture) for the Mayan children it will be the best tour/reward of your life. The hotel has lots to do (Spanish lessons, dance classes, yoga, water volleyball, water/land aerobics, water sports etc... and the beach is great. The sand is like no other your feet will touch and the water many shades of blue.. There are still a few shells to find. A few sand bags in front of the beach but you can still enjoy it. If you like buying stuff on the beach there is enough of that but they don't hound you if it's not your thing. Parasailing is fun, safe and not expesive at $50 and you can go as many as three at one time. It is the best hotel I have stayed in and I have spent half my life in Mexico. Don't listen to the negativity (nothing can make those people happy) just go and enjoy!!!!

Rooms are spartan with very little storage but kept spotless. They are trying to restore the beach area but in my opinion the beach sucks. If you are a beach lover then try a different area of the Mayan Riviera as the hotels around the Allegro all have the same problem with lack of beach area, some worse then others. Playa del Carmen, a 5 min cab ride or 20 min walk, has the type of beach as shown in brochures and has great restaurants, beach bars and a vibrant nightlife. The hotel has a very international clientele and ambiance and again, the service and friendliness of the staff sets it aside from other properties.

We stayed there from May 25-30. I was a little concerned about going to this resort after reading some of the reviews. However, it really was a great place to stay for honeymooners, families, or just with friends. We had notified the resort that we were going to be honeymooner's at the time of booking and the resort upgraded our room (closer to the beach!), gave us vouchers for free 10 minute massages at their spa, a breakfast meal brought to us one morning, and a fruit basket in the room at no additional cost! The resort was kept very clean. The grounds were beatiful! Our room was upstairs and for the most part was a great room. The A/C worked great. The maid service did an excellent job of keeping the rooms clean. The safe worked fine. The only small complaint is that the matress was a little harder than I'm used to. The buffet was average quality. It was not great but by no means was it horrible. On the Monday night that we were there they had a Mexican party and the food was really good. The snack bar down by the pool was good. The two reasturants, The Italian and The Mexican were excellent! You have to make reservations for those two but it is worth it. The hotel always had something to do if you wanted or you could just relax by the pool or beach! The entertainment at night is fun. The resort is close to 5th Avenue and the ferry to Cozumel. There are large sandbags on the resort's beach, but on the bright side it created a pool that people and children could play in without the crashing of waves. If you really want to see an undamaged beach (like I really did), Playa Del Carmen has beautiful beaches that you can walk and swim in and it is only minutes away by cab ride.. This was a great resort and we would recommend it to anyone as a great vacation spot!","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":4,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2015-03-07 06:11:18 +0300","author":"Tremaine Homenick"},{"content":"The first thing I will tell u is dont judge this place strictly by the reviews, I was pretty apprehensive at first. Wasnt sure what to expect...but then we got there and I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was. The staff were nice, but I have to be honest, I was afraid to talk to anyone who wasnt front desk staff because I wasnt interested in a time share! I asked someone where the bathroom was, and 5 minutes later he was still inviting me to a \"special breakfast\". Also dont buy any tours or excursions from the hotel they claim they have the best prices, but if u walk 3 minutes to the plaza up the road the prices are about $30 - $50 cheaper!! Definately go to Xel Ha, its amazing!!! You also have to go into Playa del Carmen, its about 5 mins from the hotel, and spend the day shopping and sightseeing. Grab the ferry into Cozumel, you wont be sorry! There is a bar there called Mr. Chiles that has $1 Coronas!!!! Even if u are not a big drinker, u cant beat $1 Coronas;) Which brings me to the nightlife in Playa Del Carmen, if u are a party animal they party till about 5 am there! The resort tends to quiet down after about midnight. The size of the resort was ideal, not too big, not too small. I liked that it was a short walk to anywhere, the beach, the restaurants, the theatre...and the rooms were comfortable. I LOVED the hammocks on each balcony. Also loved the oragami the maids did with the towels each day. We had a nice king size bed with a mattress pad on it that made it fairly comfortable. My only real complaint would be the food, but honestly I think thats just foreign food for ya, we ate both on the resort and off, and sadly the McDonalds we grabbed on the way home from the airport in CANADA at 4 am was the best food we ate all week:( I guess the fruit was okay, but I wouldnt reccommend eating too much of it! The beach was a little beat up from the hurricaine, they had sandbags in the water a little ways out, but quite honestly, the water was nice, and the beach was great for sunbathing. I would reccommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a low budget, good quality holiday.","ratings":{"Overall":3},"date":"2013-06-07 12:19:00 +0300","author":"Libby Rutherford"},{"content":"My family stayed at the Allegro Playacar from March 6-10th. Before going, I read all the reviews and thought maybe some people were just \"complainers\" when they mentioned all the bad things. Well, take note! I knew what we were getting into and I know you get what you pay for, but this resort is not worth spending your money on. We had three rooms, and as requested, we all got lower floor rooms near each other. Out of the three rooms, only one room was in working order. My parents switched rooms the second day because of a dripping, non-working air conditioning unit (among other things in their room) and my sister tried switching rooms due to a rattling air conditioning unit. And when my sister tried to switch rooms after my parents vacated their old room, the front desk tried to give her that room! As for the entertainment, I have to say what entertainment? I've been to other 3 star resorts in the Riviera Maya, and have been far more impressed with the activity staff than here. I hardly ever saw them walking around during the day and the shows at night were horrible! At the other resorts I've been to, you would know their names and faces by the end of your stay. Not the case here! Also, I really wanted to like the food and thought that it couldn't be THAT bad. Well, it was. Cold food at the buffets and almost the same version of food every day, just mixed with other things. Again, I wasn't expecting a lot, but this was terrible! Good things - the pools were nice and being able to walk into Playa del Carmen was nice. (We needed to walk to town to get any type of entertainment!) The resort overall was in need of a lot of care. I will not recommend this to anyone and hope if you go, you don't mind wasting your money on a very poor 3 star resort.","ratings":{"Overall":2,"Service":3,"Value":2,"Rooms":2,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":2,"Check in / front desk":1},"date":"2015-07-29 06:36:59 +0300","author":"Roger Blick MD"},{"content":"Stayed in this hotel 4 years ago, had a really nice stay for 2 weeks.

You are met with a welcome drink and walked to your room. Your luggage follows shortly after Rooms I would recommend asking for a ground floor room. The upper floors have thatched roofs and are apparently very musty and damp. The standard room is set up with a bed/seating area with a television and mini-bar, and then a seperate area in which there is a wardrobe and mirror. We thought the rooms were nicely decorated, but the bathrooms could perhaps do with a little updating. We liked the terrace area with tables/chairs and a hammock. We had no problems with air conditioning. The hotel provide an iron, ironing board and hairdryer, so you have no need to pack any of those items. There is a safe in the room which is free of charge too. We spent little time in the room, we would watch tv (The Warner channel!) while getting ready for the evening, it was adequate for our needs. GHD hair straighteners do not work, due to the voltage in Mexico - you are better off taking a cheaper pair & leaving them to heat up. Pool/Beach There is an activity pool, and a larger pool. There is always something going on at the activity pool e.g. volleyball, water polo, aquarobics. There is also a bar area within this pool, which is nice. The other pool is more for sunbathing/relaxation. It is generally not as busy. The beach is badly affected by recent storms, but the sandbags were fun to sit on and there are still enough loungers for people to enjoy the beach. Food & Drink Breakfast: Every type of pastry you can imagine, a toast machine is available, lots & lots fresh fruit, cereal, juices, smoothies, continantal style breakfast, eggs, sausages,. The coffee served at breakfast is delicious. Lunch: Lunch is sometimes served at the buffet, but mainly served at the snackbar near the pool. They have a barbeque going from about 11am - 3pm at which fish, beef, hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken, pork and even barbequed vegetables are served. There is also the snack bar for salads, natchos, pasta and various other meal options. Dinner: Served at the buffet or A la Carte restaurants (Italian & Mexican). We did not enjoy the Mexican so much but the Italian food was amazing. The Buffet also have theme nights, e.g. Oriental, mexican etc. There is a carvery with chicken and beef, pasta, various salads, lots of types of bread, chips, hotdogs for the kids, chicken and beef marinaded, potatoes..there seemed to be something for everyone. Pizzaria: There is a Pizzaria by the pool area open all day with many different pizza types, this was good for a snack or light lunch. Drink: The drinks were amazing. Named brands and a lovely cocktail menu. I recommend the Mai Tais. Self serve pepsi and fruit punch machine for non-alcoholoic refils during the day. The barstaff will also bring drinks to you while you sunbathe. I never had a problem with the bar queue Entertainment There are various types of entertainment during the day including xcooking competitions and water activities. We mainly relaxed during the day at the other pool so can't really comment on this, but the entetainment at night was fun - there is a large stage and seating area. We saw many shows (Mexican Hacienda, Carribean Show, Mr Allegro) and the costumes, lighting music and dancing are very professional. I enjoyed and thought that the staff worked very hard to make the shows entertaining. Disco/Bars The disco was a disappointment. the Disco plays bizarre music asuch as 'YMCA' and 'In The Navy'. It is also very small and not at all like a disco/nightclub. It does open until 2am though. Usually, we would go out for the meal, watch the Show, and then go to the Amber Bar (next to Reception) and then back to the room with drinks. If you are hoping for a resort with an exciting night-scene, this may not be the hotel for you. There is a nightclub tour to Cancun you can go on for $50 however. I think that runs once a week. Staff I found all the staff to be brilliant. We could not fault the maid service (and their towel origami!) and when we phoned for a repair, a repairman was at the apartment within ten minutes. The waiters and barstaff cannot do enough for you, and the gardners are constantly maintaining the land. The Animation Team are fun. They work at the pool all day and then at the night shows too. The only staff I have an issue with are the Reception staff. They are rude and often unwilling to help with problems. All in all we had a wonderful holiday and found it to be better than the 5* in Mexico (Bahia Principe, Tulum) we went to last year. Aside from the Bathrooms and nightlife which are only small details..our trip was perfect.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Value":3,"Rooms":3,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4,"Check in / front desk":2},"date":"2014-07-05 22:59:05 +0300","author":"Angus Kautzer"},{"content":"After many hours of reading everyones revieves I decided to stay here. This was a last minute trip and I was traveling with my husband,2 teenage daughters(20 and 18),my son 14,and my 11 year old daughter. I booked every thing through Expedia. We flew with US AIrways which was a big mistake. Never on time,and then they made us miss our connecting flight and then gave us another flight one hour away from our original destination home.But back to Allegro, our reservations included two rooms, one of which turned out perfect, while the other presented several problems for us. The room did not have enough beds as we had requested, the air conditioning didn't work, and the room was handicapped equipped which we did not need, not to mention the room had a bad smell. However, the next day we were moved to a better room which fullfilled our requests. The rooms weren't incredibley large, but we were never in them during the day. The showers are not enclosed, so water typically spills onto the floor. The staff was very friendly and everyone spoke very good english, along with several other languages. My teenage daughters also found the male employees to be quite attractive. The food was good depending on the day. They served different food for every night of the week, some nights better than others. The pool side entertainment was great, along with the hotel's nightly shows. We were rather impressed by the various perfomances we saw each night. The hotel also has a kids club which hosted activities for kids all day nad all night in order to keep the younger guests entertained. One of the drawbacks to the hotel is their timeshare presentation which lasts three or more hours, despite the promised ninety minutes. The hotel grounds are beautiful and the beach was nice despite the large sandbags which we found a way to play on. If your accustomed to fancy dinning and upscale rooms, this is probably not the best place for you. We would however, probably stay there again, although i would like to try staying at a different hotel.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":5,"Value":4,"Rooms":2,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Check in / front desk":3},"date":"2013-07-24 15:48:26 +0300","author":"Judah Turner"},{"content":"My new husband and I decided to book our honeymoon at the Occidental Allegro Playacar and it's one of the best travel decisions we've ever made. Since we were honeymooners, we made sure our travel agent alerted the hotel as such so that we could take advantage of the complimentary honeymoon priveledges the hotel offers. It's not much, but the hotel gives you a priority checkin (which we think was the representative escorting us through the property to our room), fruit basket, spa services discount, and breakfast in bed one morning. It was all perfect. Once we checked in, we were escorted to our room to wait for our bags to arrive. Well, we were starving, so we just took off to the pool to find some snacks. On the way there, we passed by The Pizzaria which was great! The pizza was hot, fresh, and tasty! After our quick slice, we headed over to the Snack Bar. OK - where I come from, \"snacks\" are things like chips, fries, chicken nuggest - you know, small portions of finger foods. Nope! This place lays out a whole spread at the snack bar. It was great! Everyday we noticed that there was always a beef, chicken, pork, fish, and vegetarian entree choice plus a potato dish, pasta dish, and a steamed vegetable. There was a full salad bar to make your own fresh salads and a grill off to the side which served fresh burgers, hot dogs, and a chicken or pork dish plus french fries. Oh yeah, there was a mini nacho bar with chips, cheese sauce, fresh pico de gallo, fresh guacamole, and cevice. It was great! After our first \"snack\", we headed back to our room to unpack and change into our swimsuits. Once down at the pool, the real relaxation began. (We opted to hang out at the activities pool everyday. We may not necessarily be the type to participate in every activity offered, but we certainly enjoy watching everyone else participate. Music is played at the activity pool and there's a swim-up bar there as well.) We hung out at the pool for a while then went to the lobby to try to make dinner reservations. I don't particularly agree with the whole reservation scheme since you're only given a choice of 600pm, 730pm, or 900pm to dine. I've been to much larger all-inclusives in the past that have ala carte restaurants and they use a first-come first-served seating policy that works just fine. You go when you want to eat then decide if you feel like waiting for a table or not. I guess it didn't much matter with our stay at the Allegro since we were able to get a reservation at our preferred time (730pm) each time we tried. Of the two ala carte menus, I preferred the menu at The Mexican over the menu at The Italian, though the food at both places was outstanding. We ate at the main buffet for the Oriental night and we also ate at the Mexican Fiesta. All of the food was delicious. Neither me nor my husband had anything we didn't like. Don't get me wrong, we're not talking gourmet-quality here, but it was all good. So, regarding our room. It was large, clean, and beautiful. We decided to go for a garden-view room since we knew we'd be spending every day-light hour at the pool enjoying the view AND the fresh air! Plus, it looked like all of the ocean-view rooms were situated near the pool and you know how water carries sound! We were assigned in building 41 which was just perfect. Right about in the middle between the pool and the main buffet. I will have to agree with some other reviews that the beds are a little hard but it is NOT due to the cement platform. They are just FIRM mattresses on the beds. The cement platforms are to help with hurricane rebuilding, not the \"cheap Mexican shortcut\" that others have claimed it to be. The vanity seemed to be newly remodeled with a fashionable bowl-style sink and round-framed mirror. The closet area could use drawers instead of shelves, but we didn't have any problem finding space for all of our things (10-days worth!). The bathroom houses only the toilet and tub/shower. Its just the right size for what you need to do in there. We had a second-story room which meant we had amazing cathedral ceilings all the way to the top of the palapa roof. If I had to guess, I'd say those ceilings are at least 25-30 feet tall! Truly magnificent. On our front porch was a hammock (which came in handy for siesta time) and a small table with 2 chairs. The whole set-up was really cool. There are only 8 rooms to each building (4 on the bottom and 4 on the top) and that gives the whole hotel a village-like feel. The grounds of this property were absolutely immaculate. I've included pictures so you can see for yourself because I'm not really sure how to describe it without sounding redundant. I've also included pics of the lobby building which the hotel fails to show on their website. I don't know why cuz the lobby is beautiful. Also, this staff was one of the friendliest staffs we've ever had the pleasure of being served by. Anytime we passed a staff member walking about the grounds, we were greeted with eye contact, a smile, and the appropriate verbal greeting for the time of day. We also liked the staff uniforms. They were neatly pressed and professional looking but also carried a tropical vibe. It was our first stay at an Occidental property, but if this is how they maintain all of their resorts, we'll look for an Occidental the next time we take a vacation. We only had 3 small annoyances. They really are quite petty as none of them had ANY bearing on our ability to enjoy our vacation. Here they are: 1. THE TIME SHARE HASSLE: We were approached by a rep on our first morning to attend the \"VIP Breakfast\". We've traveled around enough to know that the hotel staff doesn't want to eat with their guests just for the heck of it, and we didn't suddenly become a \"VIP\" out of no where and for no reason. If you can't realize that, then I'm sorry for you. If you're not interested in hearing their pitch, politely tell the rep that you are there to spend time with your family, husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, friends, or whomever you're there with and you would prefer not to deviate from your plans. It worked for us and we didn't hurt anyone's feelings or act like those \"Ugly Americans\" everyone expects us to be. 2. THE PHOTOS WITH ANIIMALS: The hotel has a professional photographer on site that goes around and takes pics throughout the day. If you've ever been on a cruise, it's kind of like that, only each day they bring in some kind of exotic animal and push for you to have your picture taken with it. They don't want to seem to take \"no\" for an answer, so I found that telling them I was allergic seemed to steer them away successfully. You don't have to pay them to take the picture, only if you want a print out. 3. NOISE FROM THE ROOM NEXT DOOR: As I said before, we were on the second floor with those amazing cathedral ceilings. Well, on our second to last night, a family with a BABY was checked in to the room next to us. We quickly learned of the disadvantage of the palapa roof - no effective sound barrier. At times it sounded like that darn baby was laying in bed with us. Fortunately, the baby didn't cry too often or for too long so we were able to still enjoy ourselves. There were times that we could hear our neighbors conversations and TV clear as day, but that was only when we were in our room which was not very often. *NOTE: The beaches of Playacar (and much of the Caribbean coast of Mexico) were severely damaged at the hands of Hurricane Wilma in 2005. The government is doing the best they can to assist Mother Nature in rebuilding the beach. REMEMBER - THE LACK OF BEACH SAND IS NOT THE HOTEL'S FAULT! That said, there is still plenty of soft white sand and chaise lounge chairs to go around. Enjoy it and save your complaints for things that the hotel CAN control.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":3,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2012-12-22 11:33:32 +0300","author":"Milford Pfannerstill"},{"content":"We came to Allergro from March 21-30 for 9 days. We loved it. We stayed in a room right by the pool. The beds were firm but fine. The rooms were upgraded and there were tubs put in as well as new very modern sinks. We loved the food. For lunch they served steaks and spanish pia and lots of grilled hamburgers and hotdogs and fries. People from the Royal Hideaway wanted our barbaque they smelled it. They were coming over to use our beach it was better.We had great drinks we brought our own thermal mugs and tiped every other drink. We had top of the line liquior. We brought our own towels and we used them because we worried about losing them. We went on the lobster cruise out of Cancun which was great we loved the lobster the drinks on the cruise were just okay order wine or beer. We had a fabulous time at the resort everyone was so friendly I brought a welcome gift for the maid a set of Rosary beads and a sterling silver belt and she also got tips she was very happy her name was flora a sweetheart. I would definately go back the breakfasts were super anything you wanted was there. We tipped the girl making eggs too at the end Lita she was also very nice. I took 350 dollars in singles and they worked out great so remember to take dollar bills. We went over to town to the beach one day but the beach right there was just as good. The hotel packed a lunch and sodas or beers whatever you want for free 6 of each. I took cancun express from the airport it was 95 for two in a private van it was very very pleasant and they were very professional. Bought crocs(35 plus charms 3.50) sandals the hottest shoe in the UK now and bought a leather duffle at Playacar for 104, at the airport it was 300 dollars great deal at the golden duck in Playacar. Its 50% off there bags now so if your going aviod the junk and buy something you'll keep.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":3,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2013-11-06 05:31:46 +0300","author":"Sabryna Bailey"},{"content":"We stayed at the Allegro Playacar Jan 17-31. Check-in was at 3:00, but we weren't given a room until 5:00. We didn't feel it was too big of a deal as it gave us time to explore the grounds, have a few drinks and get some food in us. The grounds at the Allergro are absolutelty beautiful, some of the prettiest weve seen, they should have more pictures of the grounds on their web-site. We had an upstairs room with a palapa roof. Room was average, we did have a issue with the screens, as they were torn and pulled out of the frame in areas. One call and Manuel from maintenance replaced them. We preferred having the windows open verses air conditioning in the evening. You will need a sense of adventure if you choose an upstairs room as there will be little lizards crawling about up high. They seem to stay up high and wont hurt you. There was no mold or musty odors, the bathroom did have a strong urine odor at first, but our maid Wilma took care of that. We found the staff to be very friendly and eager to please, some of the best we've ran into. The staff makes this resort. We found the food very good, and a good selection to choose from. Drinks were fair to good. The beer was on tap, sometimes flat, sometimes fizzy, sometimes very good. I drank mine with some ice cubes and lime, and almost always enjoyed it. After the first day, and a tip or two, the bartenders knew our preferences and they also knew where to find us for refills. We booked in Nov. and knew the beach was lost in Dec. but decided to come anyway, because it looked like a small laid-back resort, and are glad we did. We like the location as it is only a 15-20 min. walk to town. They are working on restoring the beach area, you could see a difference every day. You do have the timeshare people to deal with. We told them the first day we weren't interested and they really didnt bother us until the second to the last day, then it was visit a little and another no. This isn't a 5 star resort, but we didn't pay 5 star prices for this stay. We feel we got our moneys worth, and would go back again.","ratings":{"Overall":4},"date":"2015-04-28 20:53:39 +0300","author":"Lindsay Smitham"},{"content":"No beach! All photos of the resort are either prior to last years Hurricanes or of the Allegro on Cozumel. When I arrived (Sat 12/2) there was only about 20 ft of sand from the stairs (leading to the beach) to you end up in the water. On Friday the pool and the beach access was closed due to parts of the resort wall starting to fall into the ocean. When asking customer service to make arrangement to access the beach from the resort to the south (sister resort, owned by the same company) we were told no we can't help you. The customer service rep then told us that we can visit the public beach in downtown Playa ($10 round trip cab fare), but did not offer any way or compensation to get there. Rooms: The rooms sport very firm bed and have a lovely basement smell will take about 3 days to air out (or you just get immune to it?). We notice that water was leaking out of our bathroom light fixture. We called customer service twice before for maintenance showed up to look at it. Maintenance went upstairs to check it out the problem, we received no follow up and assumed it was fixed. The next morning I woke up at 5am to what I thought was rain outside. Nope, my investigation lead me back to my bathroom to find water leaking out of the ceiling light fixture faster than before (filled up a trash can in less than 1 hour). Food: The food was no more than average and was very repetitive by the third day. I will say all the wait staff and bartenders do a pretty good job of keeping you happy. Must love Cats There are several stray cats roaming the resort, these cats enjoy singing between 1am and 4am ( I met many others that enjoyed the cats). Keep your expectations low and will will not be disapointed.","ratings":{"Overall":1,"Service":1,"Value":1,"Rooms":1,"Location":3,"Cleanliness":2,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":1,"Check in / front desk":1},"date":"2012-07-11 00:43:58 +0300","author":"Niko Emard"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lon":-118.84613,"lat":34.0328},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1 310-456-5486","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":"18711 Pacific Coast Hwy","description":"30 ocean-front cottages located across from Topanga State Beach."}

THE HOTEL AND GROUNDS From the minute we stepped into the lobby and could see the beginning of the grounds we were amazed. The gardens look beautiful and are well kept and maintained. The polynesian houses are brilliant, I would rather stay in one of these any day than a high rise hotel. The whole place just looked ideal, so much nicer than you're regular hotel. ROOMS We had a room as close to sea view as you can get without having a timeshare. It was really peaceful and it was as if the whole place was there just for you, you couldn't even hear anyone else. We had a ground floor room and it was lovely, can't fault it. Not sure what people have complained about the beds for, didn't find them hard or uncomfortable in the slightest. The bed was also huge, me and my partner seemed to end up sleeping a mile away from each other we had that much space! The shower was fine too, people complaining about the shower spraying obviously don't have any real problems, the floor got a little bit wet, I mean a little bit wet, and if it hadn't been mentioned before it wouldn't be anything I'd even mention as it was not an issue at all. It had a walk in wardrobe with plenty of room for mine and my boyfriends clothes etc. The downpoint to the room was that there was only one plug socket. For all you ladies, my hair straighteners heated up fine so no worry bout that. However our psp and ipod wouldn't charge I don't know if that is to do with the voltage? My camera battery charged fine as did our mobile phones. The maids cleaned every day and left fresh towels. Our maid was a little too eager and even if we left the do not disturb sign up he would come banging waking us up early in the morning and if we ignored him he would come back ten mins later doing it again until we answered the door....when my boyfriend opened the door and tried to tell him we were sleeping and could he come back tomorrow he just stood there smiling going \"Si si!\" and smiling waiting to come in and clean, in the end we had to get up and let him clean...this was a tad annoying but not a major issue. Also we only had one swan made out of a towel the whole holiday but we saw in someone elses room he had done two swans, rose petals etc etc. Tipping didn't seem to help in the swan matter either! Again not a big issue though lol......Also someone wrote in their review something like \"imagine my horror when there was no news channel in my bedroom, how could i possibly enjoy my holiday\" or words to that effect - um this wouldn't ruin my holiday at all HOWEVER there is news channels on the TV (just to put your minds at rest!)... POOLS There are two pools, the activity pool and the relaxation pool. The activity pool was fun to be around, it had music playing most of the day, everything from UB40 to Pussycat Dolls....there was water volleyball/polo/tequila darts/beer drinking competition/kayak racing etc etc....you can get as involved or as uninvolved as you like....This is also where the swim up bar was which was lovely. You can stay in the pool till 11pm if you like so you can stay in and drink all night if you wish. It doesn't get cool even at evening so you wouldn't be cold. This is the pool that goes right out to the sea and the view is spectacular. It's great having the sea right there when you're swimming or sunbathing. The other pool was quiet and a decent size, this was great for the days you just wanted to relax. BEACH Now I don't know where the rumours of no beach has come from, maybe at one point thats how it was but certainly not now. The beach is a great size and has enough sunbeds for all without it ever seeming over crowded. The sand is white and soft and the sea is turquoise. No seawead or grotty bits just clear blue water....It's paradise...There are sunbeds under thatched parasols and ones in the sun. Also inbetween the hotel and the beach is another layer of sunbeds on a raised level with sand flooring and hoods (think pram hoods) over them to give shade to your head and shoulders...we found these a godsend after getting burnt! There is also watersports available from the beach including Jet Skis. The Jet Skis are i think about £15 for 30 mins which is quite good value. We were told its impossible to fall off them unless you do something really extreme because of the way they're designed. We however managed to fall off :-S We were fine but lost our sunglasses! Make sure you wear the wrist strap however as this stops the jet ski if you fall off. THE DRINKS The cocktails were great, sometimes strong, sometimes not so. The beer they served was Corona on draft. My boyfriend liked this but was convinced it was watered down and he couldn't get drunk on it. They had a huge selection of spirits including some brands like Bacardi, Smirnoff etc. The big let down was the soft drinks...they were branded (Pepsi) but were all completlely flat and horrible throughout the hol....the pineapple and orange juice were nice though. THE FOOD The food in the buffet resteraunt was good. They had plenty of selection, most nights me and my boyfriend would end up with completely different things from each other as there was so much selection. One word of warning though - aviod the chicken - it's very pink and very bloody everytime it was there. I never ate the chicken but however I have been very ill since I got home, I can't say whether it's been food poisoning or a virus but just be careful you choose food that is well cooked. Everything other than the chicken seemed fine. There was a great selection of food and it was all gorgeous. The breakfasts were great too and the sausage and hash browns were very like Mc Donalds which I thinks great. There was also things like waffles/pancakes for breakfast and fruit or cereal. Also I think they had smoothies and omlettes. They also had some strange things like lasagne out at breakfast, and cauliflower and carrot. People seemed to be eating them too! The food at the pool bar was mainly poor but they did have a nice potatoe salad there one day and some nice meatballs. The potatoes were usually cooked well too which is something I'm very picky about. They also had a nachos thing with cheese sauce, gaucamole, salsa etc at the pool bar which was nice. The pizza place was fine, nothing special nothing bad. The Mexican resteraunt was lovely but we loved the food at the buffet so much that we only visited the resteraunt once. LOCATION Playacar is gorgeous, it feels very safe and posh and for the first few days it was hard to believe there was a world outside of it. It only costs about £2.50 maximum to get into Playa Del Carmen by taxi which are always about outside the hotel so this is very easy. Playa Del Carmen is nice, posher than most tourist places I've been but with all the usual touristy tat....Nothing much worth buying, we bought ourselves some photo frames. NIGHTLIFE The 'club' at the hotel had loud music playing but was dead at all times, however the one pool table was always occupied. In Playa Del Carmen the best place to go was The Blue Parrot. It had one dancefloor inside that consisted of sand this played proper dancy type music. You could also dance on the speakers here. The seats at the bar were swings which seems to be the local gimik. We still loved it though. Outside, on the beach was a wooden dance floor and here they played mainly RnB and Hip Hop which I loved and although my boyfriend isn't a fan of that sort of music we managed to have one of the best nights of our life here. The drinks are stronger than the hotel and the beer you can get is Corona or Sol. A round consisting of a beer and cocktail came to around $5. Brilliant place to go highly recommended. There is also a Senor Frogs which is fine but not lively like the one in Cancun. Deseo is the place with the beds on the rooftop and it was a great place to start off the evening, really classy and chilled out. For amazing nightlife head for Cancun, a taxi will cost about £25 each way but you can get transportation via trips like the Disco Rolling Tour, or the Coco Bongos tour etc. We visted Cancun twice, once on the Disco Rolling Tour and once on the Coco Bongos one. The disco rolling tour was well organized with a guide who is very friendly and fun who looks after you all night and gets all your drinks for you. He supplied us with plenty he was never far away. You visit Congos which is supposedly a bar but it's very crazy and a lot of fun, then Senor Frogs which is slightly madder and then Coco Bongos which is the peak of the night. You spend 1 hour in Congos and then 2 hours in each of the other two places. The trip to Coco Bongos on it's own was brilliant. We had someone pick only us up, no other people, take us into Coco Bongos and then return to pick just us up all for £30 each. This was with drinks included all night. Coco Bongos is the most amazing experience you should check out the website it's really a must do on your holiday. We loved Cancun night life so much we will return there next year for our whole holiday. It is very much a young crazy place though. EXCURSIONS We did the two trips menitoned above. We also did a pirate ship tour which was probably the worst trip we booked but was still ok. The show was very funny, the pirates are great and really had us laughing. The letdown being you had a pirate assigned to however many people to bring you your free drinks, other pirates got there people loads but we got two drinks and then didn't see our pirate again and it was impossible to get drunk. There was a bit too much forced interaction, trying to dance with absolutely no space and being forced to get up and pull people you didn't know up onto the floor and rub noses with them etc.....ok if you like that sort of thing but even if you don't you HAVE to join in. Bear in mind you may well be sober too! The thing that topped it off for my boyfriend was a forced game of someone coming round collecting everyones shoes, so they took our shoes and then we were forced to go and eat while the game was still going on and we had to walk around bare foot. My boyfriend finally got his brand new trainers back completely soaked in beer so the evening went downhill for us from here. Also you are on a boat so you are completely trapped there for the duration whether you enjoy it or not. Onto a good trip was the Dolphin Swim. We did this at Dolphin Discovery which is about 15 mins from the hotel. It's around £80 each for the Royal Swim which is the best package. You have around an hour in the pool with the dolphins, you get to do a dolphin kiss, touch the dolphins, hold the dolphin like a baby, swim out and put your arms out and the dolphins come behind you and you hold there fins and they pull you along. You then do another one where you lie flat and the dolphins come behind you and push there noses into your feet so you fly out of the water. It's very fast and exciting and brilliant experience. They take lots of photos which you can purchase for around £7 each. We purchased just the one. The DVD is a brilliant memory and is a bit steep at £25 for a 5 min or so dvd but its well worth it to capture that memory. Downside of trip you dont get picked up till about two hours after you've finished your swim, I presume to try to make you spend money at the bars/resteraunts... Another great trip we did was XelHa. I never thought I'd fancy it before we went but it turned out to be one of the best trips we did. It's a full day trip and I think it cost about £40 all inclusive each. You get to snorkel in a huge lagoon (its very cold so be warned!), free hire of snorkel, flippers, rubber rings (double or single) etc... You can jump from the cliff of courage (we did this) and I have to say its not really that high. It's about 4m. It hurt me a bit when I landed but only momentarily and I was glad I did it. If you do this trip I'd recomend buyin a waterproof camera to capture the day. We did this but have yet to have it developed. It was about £13 but you couldn't take your normal camera around with you as you're in and out of water so much. There is a cycling bit which we did just to get somewhere quicker but it was suprisingly fun. The bikes had no breaks which made it slightly more scary and fun they really went fast! There was also a hammock area for relaxing which was as close to paradise as you can get. We booked only one trip through our tour operator and the rest through Gray Line. If you turn out of your hotel and go left there is a small shopping area in Playacar, they had a stand outside here and were brilliant and 100% reliable. On a downside, we booked to go Coco Bongos through a tour place in Playa Del Carmen. We paid $14 deposit and the tour never turned up. We were not so much annoyed about the money it's only £7 but that it wasted a night we'd been looking forward too. This tour company was on the left hand side as you walk down and was a tiny little place, just near a tree with a seat around it. Avoid at all costs. When we went down to complain it was shut but if it's open again do not go here. I don't know if I've included everything! No doubt I've missed something but the top and bottom of it is go!! Ignore the bad reviews, some people must be impossible to please, this is the nicest place in the world! You will love every minute!!

The rooms were falling apart and the repairs were very noticeable. The beds were so hard, my 8 and 10 year old were complaining. The food was average at the buffet and the service was poor due to understaffing. Same problem with the pool bar, always a line to get a drink. We did not get to eat at the Mexican restaurant because it was always booked and we were told by other guests that the Italian restaurant was not very good. The staff was very friendly and the activities kept my children entertained even though it was the same thing everyday. The grounds are beautiful and kept very well. The beach was clean but small. The picture on the web page is old and the beach looks totally different now. If you want shade, get to the pool or beach very very early. The evening entertainment was fair. The show was OK but it was only about 30 minutes long. I stayed at the Occidental Grand Excaret in June and it was much nicer all the way around.

However, the hotel did leave a bit to be desired. First, the current aerial photos of the hotel's beach are deceptive as there isn't a lovely 40-50' beach at the end of the main pool. There is a very narrow 20-30' beach with many people crowded into the few beach chairs. As with the pool, people come early and lay 'claim' to a beach, or pool chair, for the day - even if they're not using the chair. This means that many people have to do without a chair or squeeze into the sand. The kids club is really for very young children as the kiddie pool is a wading pool and the activities are designed for toddlers and kids under 8. My daughter spent one day in the kiddie club but was bored. The two attendants were quite pleasant but didn't take the kids out of the single room except to toss toys in/out of the wading pool. The buffet is quite extensive and offers many choices. Most items were tasty but not 'gourment'. The Mexican theme restaurant was quite good with some local dishes. The need for reservations seemed a bit odd as the times we ate at the restaurant the tables were not fully occupied. The outside (by the second pool) Italian rest. was nice also, especially if the weather is pleasant as the tables are in the open. The main lobby/office staff is quite friendly but not particulary helpful. Ex, The Internet access room was rarely open and most of the tiem the PCs were not working. If you want to check email, send mail to family, check flight times, etc. you were better off going into town to find a Internet cafe. You also had to pay for the use of the PCs and with the PCs dropping connection it was costly. The nearest pay phones are in a small shopping plaza, about 5 min. walk. I'd suggest purchasing a phone card at the plaza pharmacy as the pharmacy sells cards that work in the plaza phones. The 'town' is a working town and is a nice break from the hotel scene. It's a 20-25 min. walk (depending on if you're older or have kids) and passes by some local Mayan ruins. Take the ruin walk as it goes near a beach with nice, small hotels, condos and leads into the town. The ATM/banks in town dispense in pesos and the exchange rate was 11.50 pesos/US dollar vs the 10.00 pesos/US dollar at the hotel. The brochure we had said that the non-motorized water sports were 'unlimited'... well, unlimited is 1 hour per day per sport (ex., 1 hour of wind surfer, 1 hour of kayak, etc.) even if the sport equipment sat their unused. I wanted to take the Hobie Wave out for a couple hours (I sail in Colorado) but was told that 1 hour/day was the limit. Keep in mind that the area around the Occi Allegro is filled with other large mega-resort hotels, vacation homes, condos, etc. There is also the never ending stream of timeshare sales reps. If you walk down the beach, in any direction, you'll find thousands of tourists. The only quiet beach is South, about 1 mile and past the resorts. It was full of trash so we did some clean-up but the area needs a bulldozer to keep the refuse from blowing back into the ocean. Looks like a local Boy Scout or Rotary project is needed. The local travel agent, MLT Vacations/WorryFree, rep. was unfriendly and useless when it came to selling us tours. We eventually purchased Xel-Ha/Tulum and Coba (EXCELLENT) tours through another travel company. You can get better tour deals in town through the tour operators. *We really enjoyed the Coba tour though it was a long day of driving/stopping at other resorts to pickup tourists/and HOT. Our tour company also stopped at a Mayan village to hand out school supplies and pick up trash collected by the kids, swim in a underground cave/cenote (refreshing), and lunch next to a lake with alligarors. A good tour but lots of walking on uneven ground - bring sturdy walking shoes/socks, as well as TEVAS for swimming the cenote and a swim suit/towel. Tips: bring at least SPF40 as the sun is intense, bring a large brimmed hat/visor, bring a 1/2 sleeve or long swim shirt (Speedo) for yourself and the kids, bring a mesh bag for wet clothes/towels and to get rid of sand from the beach, plastic beach toys, wind breaker for cool evenings, leave your jewelry at home, travel pouch/waist pouch for passports, money, credit cards, Gatorade powder for long days away from the hotel, small first aid kit/bandaids. If we take the Coba tour again we'll fill a suitcase with school supplies, small metal toys, etc. for the Mayan kids. Bring at least 2 cameras - my digital camera stopped working and I'm glad I had a disposable/water proof camera as a backup. It took decent photos and we didn't mind taking it to the beach, snorkeling, parasailing, etc.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Value":3,"Rooms":4,"Cleanliness":4},"date":"2014-09-21 04:03:57 +0300","author":"Shayne Effertz"},{"content":"Thank you Allegro for a wonderful, relaxing week. Allegro Playacar is low key, well maintained, fairly small and intimate with accommodations located in multiple buildings with 8 units each - 4 upper and 4 lower. We had a lower floor unit which overlooked the relaxation pool and a bit of a view of the ocean. The room had 2 double beds which was not large, but was adequate for 3 adults. The staff was pleasant and helpful and our room was always clean. A minor problem with our shower was repaired promptly. Food was good and plentiful for most of the day and served buffet style; however, later in the evening the menu was pretty limited. We made reservations at the beachside restaurant one night and although it was a bit windy right on the ocean the great food and service more than compensated. You had the option to relax quietly or there was always something to do such as pool volleyball, aerobics, bingo, etc. and nightly shows. We tried the kayaks - small sail boats and boogie boards were also available. The beach is small and kept very clean. The evening shows were very entertaining - great dancing, elaborate costumes and a good mix of different themes. The highlight of our week was our visit to Xcaret - don't miss it ! Playa del Carmen, Tulum and Xel-ha are also well worth visiting. We found the best deals for the sightseeing trips at Walmart. This resort is good value for the money. We would definitely stay here again.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":3,"Value":4,"Rooms":3,"Cleanliness":4},"date":"2012-05-19 16:13:52 +0300","author":"Roma Orn DVM"},{"content":"I have stayed in playacar 11 times over the last 3 years have always loved the beach,people,and hotels.was there 2/2-2/8 they had just opened after repairs the beach is gone-(just south the beach is great as usual)the resturant is closed you eat on the tennis court with a tent over it food was terrible .the workers where very nice magement was rude.my son had money stolen by an employee with a key and management covered for them.","ratings":{"Overall":1,"Service":3,"Value":3,"Rooms":2,"Cleanliness":3},"date":"2012-08-09 15:08:36 +0300","author":"Jayce Ruecker"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-118.67395,"lat":34.03852},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1 310-456-6444","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":"22876 Pacific Coast Highway","description":"Has perhaps the most central location of Malibu hotels, on PCH in the heart of Malibu."}

I have stayed elsewhere and had better luck with the buffet-style food. If you are a hot dog fan ? try one at the Iberostar, they are surprisingly good. They did have well known brands of liquor, so that made up for the lack-luster meals.There are Howler Monkeys living at this resort. We apparently got a very good room (resort edge side bldg 26, 3rd floor) if you are interested in the monkeys because they used our roof as a path to the inner part of the resort. We got several pictures of them REALLY close to our balcony.This hotel is definitely nicer than the Occidental Allegro or Riu next door and we never had any trouble finding a place to sit on the beach (pool is another story). The beach is gorgeous at this hotel. There is a wait staff that will bring drinks to you on the beach - thought that was great. Tipping is greatly appreciated.I wasn?t a fan of their nightly shows. Many of the skits were bizarre and/or irritating. I did enjoy the ever-present hotel theme song and dance. Mascara (the night club) was a tad odd (they had the staff dress up in Halloween costumes), but played popular music and was open until 3am for the teenagers and night owls. Good that it is away from guest rooms because it is loud.The kids at this resort seemed really happy and the star friends seemed to keep them pretty busy throughout the day. I don?t think it is a great place for toddlers as there are quite a few accident-waiting-to-happen areas for someone so small ? especially around the pool and in the jungle. But I didn?t have any kids with me, so take that for what it?s worth. There is soft serve ice cream by the pool - a real crowd pleaser - kids were eating 4 or 5 cones a day!We didn't hang out in the pools too much during the day, besides the lack of available loungers (people do that ?saving chairs for later? thing here), the only ladies room that I could find near the pool only had 4 stalls and often had quite a pile up of women waiting. They kept it clean ? but I hope you don?t mind guys with mops in the bathroom while you are using it - happened more than once.One thing about this resort - when the sun started to go down, the pool and beach became deserted. I mean ghost town. This was a great time to go to the pool or beach and have it basically to yourself. Keep your beach towel close - they want $10 to replace it.If you have a late flight on your departure date, for $10 per hour, you can keep your room after the regular check out time of noon (based on availability). They also have a nice hospitality room that you can use after check out and will let you keep your towel cards and all-inclusive bracelets until you depart.I would stay at the Iberostar again, but I go to Playa 2 times a year and will probably check out another place next time.

There were 20 of us in our family that travelled together and I have to say that our accomodations were great. I had requested ahead of time that we be assigned to the same bungalow and as close to the pool and beach as possible and my request was fulfilled. We stayed in building #22 which was a perfect location for us - we are big time beachers so being close to the lobby was not a priority. The reviews on Quetzal our mixed and mine are as well. The positives of the resort include the service, accomodations, activities for the kids, the Star Friends and all other staff members. The negatives include the beach - although it's a beautiful beach, it is not maintained well - it is littered with cigarette butts and there are vendors that walk up and down the beach all day trying to sell their goods. Depending on the trade winds, the fumes from the motor boats and jet skiis can become quite strong when you're on the beach. The ocean water, however, was warm and very refreshing. Pool water was colder than the ocean. Alcohol choices are limited - no top shelf alcohol available and the wine is low quality as well. The food in the buffet and the specialty restaurants is average and repetitive. My family has stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro in the Dominican Republic and we were expecting the Quetzal to be along the same quality which was a bit disappointing. Despite the negatives, we had an awesome vacation. We had a blast on New Year's Eve - plenty to do that night for young and old alike. Lots of day excursions to pick from - Tulum was awesome; an absolutely breathtaking view and it's worth going with a guide to hear the history of the Mayans and their culture. Xel-Ha was a beautiful place but horribly crowded. We were there in the early afternoon and had to wait hours to get snorkel equipment - they had no masks to give us. Bring your own equipment and save yourself the hassel - snorkeling in the caves in and the park itself was wonderful but don't expect to see a lot of tropical fish - we did see a school of yellow fin tuna that was it. There was also jet skiis, ATV riding with snorkeling in cenotes, horseback riding in Cancun on the beach and parasailing to fill our days. 5th Avenue is a stop you have to make but make sure you go to the mall - it's easy to loose your way and end up on the side streets where the quality of merchandise is less and the prices seem to be a bit higher. Suggestions if you're going to Playa del Carmen - go to the ruins - Tulum is only 40 minutes away and worth the trip. 5th Avenue is great for shopping and picking up those souvenirs you'll be searching for, get comfortable with your vacation representative and the staff at the reception desk - they are full of relative information. Xel-Ha and Xcaret are filled with activities but expect to spend a full day at either one in order to make it worth your money and time. Relax and enjoy yourself! All in all, we had a wonderful vacation and are already making plans for next year. We won't return to Quetzal because there are far too many other places to visit in the world.","ratings":{"Overall":4},"date":"2013-08-29 08:30:33 +0300","author":"Kelsie Lang"},{"content":"You could do alot better at the Barceló Maya! My family and I do alot of traveling and have visited many places. I have been a Travel Agent for over 15 years and my family and I have very high standards so I think we are a good judge of things. We just got back from a stay at the Iberostar Quetzal/Tucan, we were very unhappy the food was Horrible, the same at every meal every day! unless you tried one of the specialty restaurants which your only allowed to eat at one or two times during your visit and their not that great! The rooms were dirty and the maids were not great, the beach was very dirty, garbage everywhere and all you could see was sun chair. The jungle on the property was very nice. But the Barceló Maya was by far a much better place to stay, the food their is suburb! and you felt you were the only people their because the property was so open and the beach so spread out and had so many mature palm trees. Save some money and go to the Barceló Maya and if you want some wild life go visit Xcaret.","ratings":{"Overall":2},"date":"2015-03-12 04:19:37 +0300","author":"Karli Rau Sr."},{"content":"Stayed at this Hilton for 2 nights.

It was a very nice looking Hilton Gardens (which I've stayed at many times before) but was definitely \"nicer\" than any so far. Staff was excellent, the check-in smooth. We were very tired after working hard for two days actually running a conference in DC, so it was a pleasant surprise to find ourselves in a very large room with desk, large bath, and very, very comfortable beds. Internet was fast and free, and the room came with two comfortable \"living room\" chairs. Enjoyed a good breakfast with made-to-order omelets by a perky chef and a very pleasant and helpful waitress. In the day we could see how nice the area was and we spent some time in a well stocked bookstore in the shopping malls there. Easy access to I-95 we now discovered. (my GPS definitely needs remedial lessons). This is about 10 minutes outside Baltimore and so lots to do.

The pool was small, but we did not swim anyway. I enjoyed the excercise room and I could have went to the Bally fitness center that was just behind the hotel if I wanted to, but I was ok with the equipment the hotel provided. Also, for ten dollars you can eat in their restaurant, which I recommend. The food is made to order; pancakes, omelettes, bacon, sausage, biscuits, fresh fruit, even fruit filled pancakes.

This time, we were not as impressed. The service was still excellent. And they have complimentary wine in the lobby for an hour each evening. That was nice! And the location is great -- walking distance to Pike's Market and lots of shopping. One of the first things I noticed when we got to our room was that the upholstered chair next to the bed was in tatters. No kidding. In at least four places it was not just threadbare, but literally torn down to the stuffing. For a hotel of this quality, this is completely unacceptable. Perhaps one of their doggie-guests been chewing on the chair. That's another thing. We didn't realize it was a pet-friendly hotel. I don't know if that's a new thing, but my husband never saw any pets there the first time around. Maybe because it was during the week, and this time we were there on a weekend. I'm fond enough of dogs, but I don't really want them staying in the hotel rooms that I stay in. However, it's my fault for not noticing the pet-friendly tags on their website beforehand. The dogs were well-behaved overall. There were several in the lobby off and on, and we heard barking twice from our room. Lastly, the weekend rate in February was a great deal, we thought. But that was before we added in the cost to valet park. It's posted $36 a night, but with taxes it was about $44/night. So be sure to figure that when you're looking at room rates.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":5,"Value":3,"Rooms":2,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":3,"Sleep Quality":3},"date":"2015-07-14 17:33:04 +0300","author":"Gavin Becker"},{"content":"Good, not great.

The staff did an excellent job of accommodating our request for a view. We had a view South down 4th Street. I do not think any rooms have views except of the high rises around the hotel. We ate at Sazerac Restaurant in the Hotel. They had a four course meal for a very reasonable price. We were full by the third course and had the last desert course sent up to our room. The hotel staff and Restaurant staff were very nice about it. My only real criticism was the small fridge was chock full of mini-bar treats and parking costs forty plus dollars per day. We had no room for the delicacies we bought at nearby Pike Market. So I pulled out all the little bottles of Jim Beam and put my stuff in the fridge only to reverse the process at check out.

We could tell that they did a lot of renovations to the bathrooms which was nice but the jacuzzi handle was broken so I had to call maintenance. The beds were old and a bit saggy but I could tell they were trying to keep things updated. Just not quite there yet. The hilarity was when we were ready to check out and we realized our 2-year old son had locked himself in the bedroom. He was fine (finally allowed to do what he wanted to do without us telling him no) but I think it took maintenance longer to come unlock the door than it did for them to come fix the tub handle.

I I checked into the hotel(room 723) on March 12 after my check in was complete and I was about to walk away I was handed a letter stating that the hotel will not have water from 10am - 2pm that day. At this point I find it extremely rude to give this to me after I have checked in as an oh by the way type of approach this information should have been presented before I completed check in. At 4pm on March 12 I tried to take a shower but when I turned the facet to the hot water it was extremely cold. I turned the facet to the cold water section thinking maybe the streams where crossed during the outage but that to was cold. I ended up using the warm section but this was lukewarm at best. I chalked it up to maybe the water system just needed time to get warmer since the outage. I went about my night. During the night I kept hearing a loud metal clinking noise which I believe was coming from the heating system. This loud noise happened every 15-20 minute needless to say I did not sleep. On the morning of March 13 I went to take a shower after my night of no sleep. I turned the water to hot and it was still flowing as ice cold water. I tried the cold section again and it too was ice cold. I once again took a lukewarm shower. I went to the desk to check out around 7:45 when asked about my stay I told the \"trainee\" who was completing my check out about the noise and water situation. She apologized for the issues and I asked for the number to your corporate office she did not know where it was and told me to wait for the other woman to come back. I waited and when the other front desk worker came back as there was another guest waiting she helped that person first before assisting her trainee. She was very dismissive and handed the trainee a business card that was for the Seattle location when I had asked for the corporate office. I pointed this out to the trainee and again she tried to talk to the person training her. I waited for five minutes but needed to leave to get to work as the other person working the desk was obviously trying to avoid having a conversation with me. I find this behavior along with the conditions of your hotel to be completely disgusting.

We wanted to stay in the Lower East side so our pool of hotels to choose from I guess was limited. We decided to book this hotel for 5 nights based on reviews, the hotel website and location. We stayed for 2 nights and ended up moving to Hotel Rivington around the corner. I guess the main problem was that we were into the last week of a 3 week trip around Canada and had stayed in some lovely hotels and maybe were quite spoilt. The main issue is the size of the rooms. We booked a room with 2 single beds and I believe these rooms are slightly bigger then the double rooms however they are still really, really small. Also, the rooms are quite dark and lack any real style. I had looked at the hotel website and was aware that the twin rooms had a brown/cream decor but they really are quite dull. I noticed that all rooms on this particular floor were the same regardless of bedding type. I looked at a room with a double bed that was being cleaned and it was similar but even smaller. I assume other floors have rooms with brighter decors per the hotel website. The room was very clean as was the bathroom so if you just want a bed to sleep in and don't care about decor then it is more than adequate. I was not desperate to leave but just knew that The Hotel Rivington was in a similar position, had offered me a slightly cheaper rate, rooms would be bigger and decor more stylish. The major plus of Hotel East Houston is the location if you are interested in the lower east side and the rooftop. We really enjoyed taking our breakfast up to the rooftop on trays provided and eating in front of the New York skyline. It is also within walking distance of NoLita (loved Elizabeth Street) and Soho etc... When we moved to Hotel Rivington, we were a lot happier. The room was almost twice the size, very funky in decor, had a small lounge area with couch and coffee table, a whole wall of wardrobes, automated blinds that you opened from your bed which provided a nice view of the New York skyline, a great bathroom which was grey and silver with double shower and japanese tub and every night there was a turndown service with a different type of sweet example brownies. Although the room rate did not include breakfast like Hotel East Houston, it was $10 cheaper. Hotel East Houston was just not right for us. It is not a bad hotel by any means and I probably would have stayed the whole 5 nights if I was not aware of The Rivington.","ratings":{"Overall":3},"date":"2012-12-08 12:58:50 +0300","author":"Abagail Quitzon"},{"content":"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights on a pre xmas shopping break in November 2009 and found it to be a really good choice, the rooms are very small as per some of the other reviews, and as a result storage space is practically nil, and the free WiFi isn't really worth bothering with because it keeps dropping out. However they are the only negatives of the hotel, the location is great for access to Soho, Noho & Greenwich village on foot, while the uptown madness is also only a short ride away on the F V subway line or by foot also. I noted one of the other reviewers complained about the price, saying he was paying near Â£250 a night, I'd also be insensed if I was paying that much but we picked the East Houston for economy and location, paying only Â£130 a night and to that end we feel we got what we paid for. Rooms are clean and the shower room, while having one glass wall which isn't ideal, is a reasonable size. Decor is attractive while being unremarkable, in the flock wall papered style favoured by 'boutique' hotel proprietors. There is an iPod docking stereo in the bedroom and bulgari toileteries in the bathroom. Most importantly the room was clean and the the bed comfortable, even if you may be disturbed by the traffic and street life outside, but you'd have to expect that from a city that never sleeps.","ratings":{"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Value":3,"Rooms":3,"Location":4,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2012-07-18 18:49:56 +0300","author":"Jammie Morar"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lon":-121.8999195098877,"lat":36.58717315430589},"free_breakfast":true,"email":null,"phone":"+1 831 375-2168","vacancy":false,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":"1288 Munras Ave","description":"Affordable hotel accommodations with comfortable, clean rooms."}

Had an issue using the Homewood Suites last year during a business conference that was very much related to housekeeping issues so this year on the advice of the person who took my reservation at the location, opted to stay at the connected Garden Inn as it is more \"hotel\" for vacationing versus HS which caters more to business travel. She offered to add in the breakfast as a comp as it was included in the Homewood Suites stay which was the same price and stated she would note this on our reservation. Upon arrival, the breakfast was not noted in the reservation record but it was quickly added without an issue. Went up to the room and the floors were very dirty. You could literally see food from a previous occupant on the carpet, huge stain of \"some sort\" on the chair, water all over the bathroom floor (puddles, not just damp!) and water dripping from the bathroom ceiling as if they had turned on the hot water, closed the door and just left it like that for quite some time. Contacted the front desk, they sent up a housekeeping super to help us move to another room and even he was taken back by the dirt and the nasty look of the stain on the chair (use your imagination!). They moved us across the hall and down a bit to a room that was larger but it too was dirty! There was literally someone's food wrapper on the floor right in front of the door before you even got into the room! Again, the carpet looked as if it hadn't even been vacuumed! Stopped on the way down to our dinner reservations and requested they properly clean the original room and move us back to the original room when we returned that night. The first room had a nice view of the water and the second overlooked an interior courtyard....no thanks! At this point I am feeling that if they don't vacuum, what else do they skimp on in terms of cleaning. We get back from dinner, move our things, room looks clean, \"stain\" on chair is either gone or they flipped the cushion...don't want to know. We go to the rooftop garden to enjoy the view for a few minutes and when we try to get back in, our passkey won't open the door! Hit the intercom button for several minutes with no response and now we are getting quite nervous. Its about 11PM, we have no cell phones, and we're stuck outside with no jackets. Someone finally answers the page and says they'll have to find someone to send up. My husband starts walking the entire park area and finally finds another door that will accept our key and we get inside...never seeing a staff member! Breakfast was definitely not up to Hilton standards and when the manager stopped by the table to say hello and ask us for suggestions to improve the food or service we suggested that they might want to at least cook the potatoes. He checked them, apologized and thanked us for the input...very nice man. The food (yes I know it was free due to the comp!) is not great. The bacon is so thin you can see through it for heaven's sake. Same thing when we were on the Homewood side last year as it is a shared kitchen. It was just very poor for a Hilton. I love love love my Hilton experiences and with two bad ones at the same location you really have to question what is going on. When we went to check out, the manager on duty said she was also the manager who was on when we were having issues the day before and that she was aware of what was going on and had addressed the issue with the staff. I suggested she might want to walk the property including the common areas and see the dirt in the hallways, the less than Hilton standards in the rooms, etc. She said she does do that and that was pretty much it. I really felt that my comments were not heard and nothing further was done. I sent Hilton Corp. my comments about this stay over 2 weeks ago and heard nothing back. This location is soooo perfect for the harbor area and Fells Point that it is sad that it doesn't live up to Hilton standards. I absolutely will still recommend Hilton to anyone who asks because there is usually a very high standard with the company but definitely not this one.","ratings":{"Overall":3,"Service":3,"Value":3,"Rooms":3,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":2,"Sleep Quality":4},"date":"2013-06-25 20:04:57 +0300","author":"Dana Hegmann"},{"content":"Stayed here during the 4th of July.

The Ritz lobby is like a little oasis tucked just 12 floors above a busy metropolis.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5},"date":"2014-11-07 02:10:19 +0300","author":"Lucie Schmitt"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lon":-116.537248,"lat":33.814881},"free_breakfast":true,"email":"info@Lajoyainn.com","phone":"+1 760 327-6413","vacancy":true,"free_parking":true,"price":"$89–169","address":"545 Warm Sands Drive","description":"Private gay men's clothing optional resort.

The rooms are very dated and worn. The white paint on the doors and walls has started to turn yellow. Antique televisions stuck in a corner of the room. The staff switched our room 3 times, but moving us to a lake view room does not make up for the torn and stained rugs. They finally moved us to the Four Seasons around the corner which was excellent in comparison.","ratings":{"Overall":1,"Service":4,"Rooms":1,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":1,"Check in / front desk":4},"date":"2015-02-04 10:59:33 +0300","author":"Leatha Huel"},{"content":"Over the top...every aspect of this beautiful hotel was over the top. Every staff member was lovely, the place is impeccably clean and the hotel is beautifully decorated. It was a huge treat to stay somewhere so special. I just wish that we had more time to relax and enjoy it. We were in Chicago on business which left little time to use all the facilities. On our next visit, we will be sure to add another day to our stay so that we can enjoy the pool, steam room sauna and whirlpool. I will also book a massage and/or a facial. The Ritz couldn't have been nicer.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4,"Check in / front desk":5},"date":"2014-02-12 08:24:23 +0300","author":"Casandra Rodriguez"},{"content":"Just back fronm a long w/end in Chicago.

I surprised my husband for his birthday, and I am happy to say that this was the best birthday he's ever had! We checked in and met the most pleasant and helpful woman ever, Michelle G.. She overheard my husband telling the bell hop that it was his birthday so she offered a room upgrade for a very small charge. I have to admit, I had tears in my eyes when we walked into our Grande Suite. We have 6 kids and we don't get out very much, so this was a night that I will never forget. As a matter of fact, I will hold the memories fresh in my mind and look forward to our next visit. I will not \"try\" another hotel, there's no reason to. Everything is within walking distance. We walked to Oak Street Beach, walked to the 900 Shops, had an amazing dinner on Rush Street and had a breathtaking view of Lake Michigan. Every employee was so kind, everything was clean and we couldn't hear any other hotel guests the entire stay. I don't know quite how to say thank you.... Forget the other hotels, The Sutton Place is the place to go!","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2012-12-30 04:39:10 +0300","author":"Emerson Pfannerstill"},{"content":"We had read mixed reviews about this hotel and were a little scared upon arrival. We loved it! My husband and I took off for a few days and never regretted our stay at the Sutton Place. Clean room, nice bathrooms, great location and walking distance to Magnificent Mile. The one thing we did not like was there was only one outlet in the room and it was behind the curtain so we did not find it until the last day. The beds were extremely comfortable as well. Concierge was great, they gave us \"priority seating\" for Gino's east pizzeria we also got free breadsticks for using it. O'hare airport is about 20 minutes away with a taxi and will cost roughly $35. Original house of pancakes was right across the street but I recommend eating at Tempo Cafe two blocks down. Pancake house kicked us out for bringing in a star bucks cup. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Chicago.","ratings":{"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5,"Rooms":5,"Location":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Sleep Quality":5},"date":"2013-06-25 10:09:59 +0300","author":"Kennedi Feil"}],"state":"California","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lon":-116.536726,"lat":33.814735},"free_breakfast":true,"email":"info@warmsandsvillas.com","phone":"+1 760 323-3005","vacancy":true,"free_parking":false,"price":null,"address":"555 Warm Sands Drive","description":"Intimate gay men resort, close to down town Palm Springs."}
