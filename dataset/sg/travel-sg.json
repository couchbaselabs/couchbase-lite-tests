{"_id":"landmark_604","activity":"see","address":null,"channels":["France"],"city":"Avignon","collection":"landmarks","content":"'''Le Pont Saint-Benezet''' is a ruined bridge not far from the Palais des Papes. The bridge was built in the Middle Ages - before the arrival of the Papacy - perhaps partly to allow the local bishop to cross the river to Villeneuve-lès-Avignon, where the church authorities had installed themselves because of Avignon's then-infamous dirt and lawlessness. The legend of the bridge's building is that a local shepherd, Benezet (a dialect form of Benedict) was inspired by angels to build a bridge. When his appeals to the town authorities proved fruitless, he picked up a vast block of stone and hurled it into the river, to be the bridge's foundation stone. Convinced by this demonstration of divine will, the bridge was swiftly built. The poor shepherd boy was canonised, and his chapel remains on the surviving portion of the bridge. If the bridge was divinely inspired, the Deity must have quickly changed his mind, because before long the bridge became unsafe and, following numerous floods, mostly derelict. Originally, the bridge had 22 arches, reaching across to the tower of Philippe le Bel via the mid-stream île de la Barthelasse. Only 4 of the 22 arches now remain. A multilingual audio tour of the bridge explains some of the local history. The well-known song &quot;Sur '''[http:\/\/www.travel-avignon.info\/pont_d_avignon.html Le Pont D'Avignon]'''&quot; (on the bridge at Avignon) refers to the bridge. The bridge itself is far too narrow for dancing or festivals - the original text of the song was &quot;Sous (under) le pont d'Avignon&quot;, referring to the festivals and entertainments staged on the île de la Barthelasse. The current version was popularised by a 19th-century operetta, whose librettist clearly assumed that 'sous le pont d'Avignon' would have meant in the river.","country":"France","directions":null,"email":null,"geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lat":43.953585752199189,"lon":4.8051685876271222},"hours":null,"image_direct_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/aa\/Pont_d_avignon.jpg","name":"Le Pont Saint-Benezet","phone":null,"price":null,"scope":"travel","state":"Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur","tollfree":null,"url":null}

Although this effect is unproven in its pure form, the Guggenheim nevertheless changed the world wide perception of Bilbao. The graceful, sensuous curves, evocative of the ships that used to be ubiquitous along the docks of Bilbao, are covered in titanium squares, which resemble the scales of a fish and shimmer in the sunlight. In keeping with the maritime theme, appropriate for the setting, the skylights of the largest gallery (formerly known as the Fish gallery) are designed to look like the fins of fish. Many parts of the building are purely decorative, and don't serve any purpose.

{"_id":"landmark_659","activity":"see","address":null,"channels":["France"],"city":"Fontainebleau","collection":"landmarks","content":"This is one of the most beautiful chateaux in France. Its interior decorations are especially interesting as a fine example of the French Renaissance style. At the same time, its historical significance is hard to overestimate, since it was the preferred residence of French kings and emperors for 7 centuries. The first mention of the castle dates back to 1137 but by the time when François I decided to make it his principal residence (1527), the medieval castle was mostly in ruins. This monarch undertook an ambitious reconstruction program, playing himself the role of the chief architect and inviting two prominent Italian artists, Rosso and Primatice to decorate the interior. Their collaboration resulted in such treasures as the François I gallery (pictured right) with wooden panels, stuccoes and frescoes depicting various episodes from the life of the king; the Church of the Trinity and the Ball room are also from this epoch. After François I, many French monarchs chose Fontainebleau as their residence; the construction started by François I was mostly completed under Henri II and Henri IV. Louis XIII, the son of Henri IV was born in Fontainebleau; the tourists can see the room where Marie de' Medici delivered the baby and imagine how crowded it was at the time: to avoid any risk of substitution, the birth of the king must take place in presence of many witnesses.Somewhat neglected during the French Revolution, the Fontainebleau castle is back to its glory under the reign of Napoleon I, who lived there for a long time and bade his farewell to his troops in the court of the castle in 1814. The visitor can see the Emperor's Throne room (unique in France) and his private apartments. Pope Pie VII visited Fontainebleau twice, first as a guest and then as a prisoner of Napoleon; the papal quarters have recently been opened to visitors. After your visit to the main building, do not forget to take a stroll in the park and the gardens around the castle; you will see Diane's fountain and (if you are lucky) meet one of the peacocks who live there. Although by no means less interesting than the Versailles castle, the Fontainebleau castle is a bit more difficult to reach and less known to tourists; as a result, there are at least ten times less visitors in Fontainebleau than in Versailles. Except maybe on national holidays, there is never a queue to get in, and you can explore the immense castle almost on your own, which, together with the fresh air and the absence of street vendors contributes to make your visit a very peaceful and enjoyable experience. The castle is open every day except Tuesday, January 1, May 1 and December 25th, from 9h30 to 17h in winter and from 9h30 to 18h in summer. As of April 2011, the entrance fee for adults is 10 euros; children below 18 and residents of the European Union below 26 enter free.

Each year, millions of visitors come to walk (13 million in 2006). 40,000 years ago, nomadic populations were established near the forest. Around the year 1000, the forest was composed of a series of enclaves that shared little lords and wealthy landowners . For the kings of France, the forest had indeed many uses including hunting and a military interest. In 1400, Charles VI ordered the first amendment of the forest. Under Francis I, the forest consisted of only 13 365 ha but the Kings expanded it through acquisitions and forfeitures. It was at this time the management of the forest and administration took shape and was kept until the Revolution. At the time of Louis XIV, less than 20% of the area was forested. Colbert launched a new reformation in 1664 replanting the sites. The king then traverses the forest each year in the fall for hunting. In 1716, after the terrible winter of 1709, a new forest management was enacted: 6000 ha were planted with deciduous trees, but this was an almost total failure. A new development was revived in 1750. In 1786, a shy introduction of Scots pine is attempted. In 1750, around 90 km from the forest is bounded by 1050 terminals still visible today. After the Revolution, after many deep cuts and proliferation of game misconduct hunting Napoleon in 1807 reformed the forest administration and the castle. In 1830, the planting of 6,000 ha of other pine angered artists who seek inspiration in the forest. In 1839, Claude-François Denecourt released its first guide forest walks and trails the first landscape in 1842 In 1849 the railway arrived at Fontainebleau, which will allow Parisians to visit Fontainebleau by day trips . In 1861 was created the first artistic reserve 1097 ha. It is the first nature reserve in the world, even before the creation of Yellowstone National Park in the United States.

{"_id":"landmark_832","activity":"see","address":"Place de la Hôtel de Ville","channels":["France"],"city":"Paris","collection":"landmarks","content":"Many feel that this, Paris' town hall, is one of the loveliest buildings in the city. You might not get that from the front view, but try watching the light change on its roofs and towers during sunset from one of the cafés on the Ile de St. Louis, the '''Lutece''' for instance. Alternatively, go to the top floor of the Bazar de l'Hôtel de Ville (BHV) department store opposite, on rue de Rivoli and walk up a flight of stairs to the roof terrace (terrasse), from which there is a dramatic view of both the roof of the Hôtel de Ville and the immediate surroundings and river. The present Hôtel de Ville replaced the 16th century original which was burned down during the Commune in 1871. A pastiche of its predecessor, but on a far larger scale, it was designed by the architects Ballu and Deperthes, chosen after a competition, and was mostly completed by 1882. The building is lavishly, and some would say heavy-handedly, decorated both inside and out, and finished in an arrestingly white stone, similar to that used for the even more eye-catching Sacre-Coeur basilica. The statue on the garden wall on the south side is of Etienne Marcel, the most famous holder of the post of &quot;prevôt des marchands&quot; (provost of merchants) which pre-dated the office of mayor. Marcel came to a sticky end, lynched in 1358 by an angry mob after trying to assert the city's powers a little too energetically. The current mayor, Bertrand Delanoë, a socialist and the city's first openly gay leader, shares some of Marcel's ambition and almost shared his fate. He was stabbed in the building in 2002 during the first all-night, city-wide Sleepless Night (Nuit Blanche) festival when the long inaccessible building's doors were thrown open to the public. But Delanoe recovered and has not lost his zeal for access, later converting the mayor's sumptuous private apartments into a crèche for the children of municipal workers. The Hôtel de Ville was for many years the private fiefdom of Jacques Chirac, France's president before Sarkozy, and was the site of a scandal centring on both illegal jobs given to Chirac's party members and an immense entertainment budget. General de Gaulle greeted the crowds from a front window in 1944 when Paris was liberated from the Germans and Robespierre was shot in the jaw and arrested in the original building in 1794. Admirers of Hôtel de Ville's architecture will want to know that Ballu also built the Church of La Trinité in the 9th arrondissement and the belfry of the town hall of the 1st arrondissement, opposite the Louvre's east façade. Ballu also restored the Tour St Jacques (see below), which has recently been uncovered after restoration work lasting over a decade.","country":"France","directions":"Metro: Hôtel de Ville","email":null,"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":48.856389,"lon":2.3522219999999998},"hours":null,"name":"Hôtel de Ville","phone":null,"price":null,"scope":"travel","state":"Île-de-France","tollfree":null,"url":null}

Earlier, 318 priests had been hacked to death nearby by a mob on 3 September 1792. The church underwent significant restoration in the 19th century, ensuring the preservation of the building, which by that date represented a fascinating mix of styles: 6th century marble columns placed alongside Gothic vaults and supported by Romanesque arches. Famous burials within the church include René Descartes (philosopher), Nicolas Boileau (poet) and King John Casimir of Poland, who had become (in 1669, before his death) abbot of the church's monastery.","country":"France","directions":"Métro: St-Germain-des-Prés","email":null,"geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lat":48.853940000000001,"lon":2.33406},"hours":"Open Daily 8.00AM - 7.30PM","name":"Eglise Saint-Germain-des-Prés","phone":null,"price":null,"scope":"travel","state":"Île-de-France","tollfree":null,"url":null}

At 113 metres long, 58 metres in width and 34 metres tall, it is only slightly smaller than Notre-Dame and thus the second largest church in the city. It is dedicated to Sulpitius the Pious. During the 18th century, an elaborate gnomon, the Gnomon of Saint-Sulpice, was constructed in the church. In front of the church itself is the magnificent Place Saint-Sulpice which contains the 'Fountain of the Four Bishops'. The church has a long-standing tradition of talented organists that dates back to the eighteenth century. In 1862, Aristide Cavaillé-Coll reconstructed and improved the existing organ built by François-Henri Clicquot. Though using many materials from Clicquot's French Classical organ, it is considered to be Cavaillé-Coll's magnum opus, featuring 102 speaking stops, and is perhaps the most impressive instrument of the romantic French symphonic-organ era. Its organists have also been renowned, starting with Nicolas Séjan in the 18th century, and continuing with Charles-Marie Widor (organist 1870-1933) and Marcel Dupré (organist 1934-1971), both great organists and composers of organ music. The current organists are 'titulaire' Daniel Roth (since 1985) and 'assistant titulaire' Sophie-Véronique Cauchefer-Choplin. In Saint-Sulpice Sunday organ recitals are held on a regular basis (Auditions du Dimanche, following the High Mass, usually from 11:30am till 12:05pm, during the subsequent mass, a visit of the organ loft is possible).","country":"France","directions":"Métro Saint Sulpice","email":null,"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":48.850960000000001,"lon":2.33487},"hours":"07:00AM to 6:45PM","image_direct_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/40\/P1000718_Paris_VI_Eglise_Saint-Sulpice_reductwk1.JPG","name":"Eglise de Saint Sulpice","phone":"+33 1 42 34 59 98","price":"free","scope":"travel","state":"Île-de-France","tollfree":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.paroisse-saint-sulpice-paris.org\/visite.aspx"}

The tower has recently begun allowing online reservations at its website, allowing visitors the choice of a date and time frame. Bear in mind that if you miss the time on your ticket, it's useless. The north, west, and east pillars have elevators that go to the first and second floors; the south pillar has stairs that can be climbed to the second floor. To reach the top floor, an additional elevator ride is required, and the wait for this can be very long as well. Unfortunately, disabled visitors are not allowed beyond the second floor due to safety concerns. Taking the Métro as far as Ecole Militiare and then strolling up the Champ de Mars is a lovely way to arrive at the tower.

The monument was commissioned by Napoleon in 1806 as a tribute to his victories as Emperor of France - it was finally completed in 1836, long after his death. 50 m (150 ft) high and 45 m wide, the Arc de Triomphe is decorated with battle scenes and martial sculptures that includes ''La Marseillaise'' by Rude. More recently, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was placed beneath the arch in 1920, where an eternal flame burns in tribute to the French dead of both World Wars. The arch is surrounded by a large roundabout, aptly known as ''l'Etoile'' - 'the star' - with 12 thoroughfares leading off from it. Visitors can purchase a ticket to climb to the top of the arch, from where magnificent views spread out over western Paris. Admission to a small museum devoted to the history and meaning of the monument is included. The central island and the arch are accessed by an underground passage.

This is hard to find in the city-I'd even be willing the pay a little more for the quiet, but you don't have to here! The best part about this place is the value.

Good location for walking north up the Magnificent Mile, close to many excellent restaurants, and around the corner from the theatre district. Excellent nearby public transportation. We especially appreciated the hotel staff. All were professional, helpful and attentive. The 5-6 p.m. wine hour was well managed and also offered a small tray of hors d'oeuvres. The atmosphere is subdued elegance with a small entry reception area, and beautiful well designed guest rooms in an art deco style. Considering how close it is to the trams, which is a plus if you like to use public transportation, we were not disturbed by the noise.You need to ask if you wish a coffee pot in the room. Hot beverages are available in the lobby in the morning. Cold beverages were available throughout the afternoon. Would definitely go back to the Hotel Monaco Chicago.","date":"2015-05-25 08:45:02 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Miss Jaydon Little","content":"Just got back from long weekend in Chicago at the Monaco.

We enjoyed everything about the hotel! Beds are SIX diamond, room service was nice, the room was extremely clean, staff was friendly and the AC temperature was perfectly cool! The bartender Dan makes a killer bloody mary at the attached restaurant. I'm officially a fan of the Kimpton brand after having such a great experience at Hotel Monaco! If only they had a location in New Orleans or San Antonio! A few things to know before your stay..using the business room was a bit overpriced, so if you have to print anything off during your trip try to do it before you get there. Also, if you want your room cleaned when you leave for the day just $@!#% around the sign on the door so it says Service. The maid service was outstanding so I recommend it! We left to see the sights around 12PM each day and they still came to our room each day, Another couple travelling with us did not get their room cleaned because they did not use the door sign, One of the friends I travelled with works for a very popular hotel chain and agrees that this place rocks! Room 410 has no cushion in the window seats but we were so impressed with the rest of the room, I'd still recommend it...the view and overall experience was worth MORE than what we paid. :)","date":"2014-04-28 00:48:20 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":null,"vacancy":true}

And that is a GOOD thing. The decor, style and ambience of the hotel have held up well and are top notch. We were upgraded to a great Riverview room and absolutely loved the window seats and the view from the room. Perhaps the best thing about the Monaco is the location. Right on the bottom edge of the Miracle Mile and at the top of Chicago's Loop district - with easy access to everything - you could not ask for a better locaiton to take in all the city has to offer. You can almost walk to everything depending on how ambitious you are. We walked (with kids aged 8 - 14) from the hotel to the Shedd Aquarium, the Miracle Mile, the Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower), Navy Pier, etc... and while some of the walks were a bit long (1.5 miles) they went by quickly. Easy access to the \"El\" (elevated train) only one block down the street from the hotel is also a plus as is the immediate access (and view) of the river where you can take water taxi's and sightseeing trips along the river. As in all big cities parking is a bit much ($42 per day) which is in & out access (valet only attached to the hotel) but you can choose to park in a \"self-park\" nearby for approx $30 per day. On this trip, we chose to take the Amtrack train which was a good option coming into Union Station and a 5 minute cab ride ($7.50) to the hotel worked out well. On departure, (back to Union Station) we took a water taxi from Michigan Ave river bridge area (about 1 block from hotel - $2 per person) and the water taxi ride took about 10 minutes to the Madison Ave dock (about 2 blocks from Union Station). So the water taxi ride was well worth it to see the city form a different perspective. Back to the Monaco - the Hotel was 14 stories and we had a room on the 14th floor (1408 to be exact) which was a double queen bed room with PLENTY of space with two window seats to take in the view of the city. In fact, you could sleep on one of the window seats overlooking the river, views of Willis Tower, etc.. (which one of us did and I must say it was pretty cool). The service was excellent and attentive, we never had to worry about a thing. Being a boutique hotel, the Monaco is the perfect combination of medium size and great service. We definitely did not feel like we were \"just another guest\" as sometimes happens in larger hotels. No pool here but who needs one with so much to do in the area. They do have a decent workout room. Short walk to Millenium Park, Buckingham Fountain, Miracle Mile, Theatre District, etc... who could ask for more from a place to stay. And the AAA rate was more than reasonable if you can get it. All in all, one of the best vacations ever and in large part due to the comfortable hotel and location which we were lucky to get. Thanks Kimpton and thanks Hotel Monaco. Our new favorite. We will be back. Note: The Monaco also has sister properties (The Hotel Burnham and Hotel Allegro) in the same area - which I have stayed at while on business years back - and these are similarly well run...that being said, you just can't beat the location of the Monaco. In my opinion, the Burnham is very cool for it's architectural history and feel and the Allegro is somewhat of a \"hip\" style - but each of the hotels definitely deserves a four star rating. Note: While I hate to even mention this subject when speaking of the Monaco...I was quite concerned when looking for places to stay about the \"B e d b u g issue\". We all know it is an increasing problem in many hotels. I can safely say The Monaco has no such problems that we could tell. Totally clean. Trust me, I looked. No problems at all. In fact, teh room and beds were so clean and comfortable, I slept great.","date":"2012-01-08 03:48:12 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Lacey Stanton","content":"My plan yesterday was to travel by train Washington to Chicago and continue to Arizona.

I was delighted with the Hotel Monaco, this being the third Kimpton Hotel in which i have stayed. I appreciate their sleek, artsistic decor and nice little touches. The staff were most helpful and I was recommended Andy's Jazz Club a few blocks away, where I spent an enjoyable evening. Referring to some of the other reviewers comments, I was on the back of the building and looked into a bick wall. Not a problem - the room was gorgeous. Now I don't mean to be too picky, but for the price of the room I do note these two items: the curtains did not completely close and the bathtub was very ordinary looking. Considering the thoughtful decor and fixtures, I am surprised that they decided to leave a bathtub which looked like the house I grew up in.

The window seats were cute too, loved the view, but I did notice that depending on the room you have, the window size varies. The service at this hotel was incredible. Everyone said Hi as you walk in and out, they hold the door, ask if you need a taxi etc. We had drinks one night at the bar downstairs and the bartender was very friendly. We got into the elevator with one of the employees one night and he asked if we were having a good stay, and my fiance said we just got engaged (he proposed in millennium park the first day we were there) and he told us congratulations and said he wanted to do something for us and asked for our room number. Later that night when we came back to the room a bottle of champagne and a card from the hotel was waiting for us. It was so thoughtful of them. They didn't have to do that for us, but they did. The location of this hotel is the BEST. It is just a block or two away from the mile, and a couple of blocks away from millennium park. We both thought this was the PERFECT location to see everything in Chicago. We walked everywhere. We went out every night for dinner across the river and it was an easy walk and we felt safe. Everyone is out and about. The only issues I had was the pillows were not comfortable and also we were close to the elevators so we could sometimes hear people outside.

The location is terrific, overlooking the river in a nice area close to restaurants and shopping. I stayed in a fifth-floor two-room corner suite with great views. My rooms were very comfortably furnished with oversized couches and chairs, two large flat-screen TVs, and three huge cushioned window seats looking out at the river. I enjoyed the large whirlpool tub with an ample jar of fragrant bath salts on the side. The downsides were a corner shower so tiny that I literally had difficulty turning around, a VERY limited room service menu, and construction noise during the night from the street below. This is a boutique hotel, so there is no bar or real hotel restaurant; if you go through a door at the end of the hall in the lobby you enter the South Water Kitchen, a casual-looking place that I didn't try. The hotel has a complimentary wine hour from five to six in the evening in the lobby, which is nice but rather spartan: the wine was accompanied solely by a dish of olives and a glass filled with breadsticks. There is nothing on the room service menu in the way of snacks or something light to tide you over to a late dinner. One other weak point was that my room did not receive turndown service on either of the nights I stayed there. On the second night I telephoned housekeeping a few minutes after 8:00 p.m. to request turndown service, as I was about to leave for a 9:30 dinner reservation. I was told that the hotel does not provide housekeeping services after 8:00 p.m. This makes no sense to me in what is supposed to be a luxury hotel. After all, not everyone goes to dinner at 6 p.m. in a city like Chicago.

The Hotel Monaco does a nice job making you feel welcome but it is no Park Hyatt as far as the greeting goes. What I mean is that the PH has at least 6 people meeting you between the car and the front desk. At the HM there is a person to help you with your luggage (dressed a bit casual, I thought) and the person at the front desk. The front desk was very pleaant and informed us that our room was not ready but would call when it was, which she did. We had the hotel hold our luggage while we went to see Wicked (loved it!). When we returned our room was ready and we were given a key. Unlike the Park Hyatt, we were not taken with our luggage up to the room. Instead we were pointed to the elevator and the luggage came up a few minutes later. We splurged and stayed in the Karen Newburger (sp?) suite. Since I was not able to find any info on this suite, I will try to elaborate as much as possible. The door is special with curtains pulled back along the side and the door itself is padded. Nice touch! You feel special just arriving! Inside the door is a small hallway with a closet containing the robes (safari prints), even ones for the children, Karen N. pjs and socks that you can buy, ironing board and iron, blankets, etc. The blanket was extremely soft~ My dd13 loved to wrap it around herself while lounging in the window seat! Next is the dining\/living room. There is a small round table with two chairs, a couch that makes into a queen size bed (not too comfy according to dds), a cupboard with games and misc. in it with a fountain hanging above it. They make a big deal of this fountain on the website but it's just ok. This room also has a LG flat screen tv on the wall and a big window seat with lots of pillows. Each window seat (I think there are four total) has a very comfortable cushion to sit on...So comfortable I could easily sleep on it! The window seats are very deep with a ton of pillows. Our family loved to people watch from these, especially the construction of the Trump Tower just across the street. We also enjoyed watching the boats on the river. The next room contains the king size bed which was very comfy with a pillowtop on the mattress. There is a bench at the foot of the bed, a tv in an armoir which also holds the honor bar, a large, very tall chair with a small table next to it where we put our 2 goldfish, and 3 more window seats. Lastly is the bathroom with a very large deep tub with a built in sitting area like in a juccuzi. It has jet sprays too. The sink is adequate with a rolling cart underneath with a blowdryer, wash clothes, and fizzing bath balls (I tried one and it was just ok, I think it cost $6). The shower stall is very small with no room for the shampoo, conditioner, and soap. The shower is stuffed into the corner like they used up too much room for the tub and the shower was an afterthought. The toilet is in the same room as the shower and tub. There was only one garbage can in the whole suite, the one in the bathroom. The towels are very soft! We had room service which was timely and very courteous. The bellstaff was friendly, helping with restaurant suggestions. On our departure, the bellhop was also efficient and friendly. We didn't partake in the evening wine festivities so can't discuss that. Overall, my family enjoyed the hotel and would recommend it. Especially if you are planning on doing activities close by.

Fantastic service, friendly and accommodating. We loved the room, the view and the beautiful, funky furnishings. It was a pleasure...then back to the Hotel Burnham in the morning for another excellent stay in a beautiful room with wonderful service from bed turn-down to chocolates, soft music on the radio and bathrobes on the bed awaiting us after a long evening out sightseeing.

On our first night, the concierge recommended a very good local Italian restaurant within an easy walking distance. Housekeeping services were prompt and thorough.

The Hotel Monaco in Chicago couldn't have been more perfect for our stay. We had a Mediteranean Suite to accomodate 2 adults and two teens for 4 nights... the corner suite was right on the corner facing the Chicago River and we had 4 of the famous window seats that everyone raves about. My 12 year old was so taken by them that we cancelled his roll-away and he slept on one everynight.... two of them were the size of twin beds, and every afternoon we'd climb in one together and sit with cocktails\/ cokes and watch the city go by! It was one of the things that make a trip truly special and I have no doubt the kids will every forget it. The location was terrific -- close to the Theatre District, the museum campus, the Art Institute and Milennium Park\/Grant Park -- we walked to everything except the museum campus -- it was too hot to go that far. The valets and front desk staff were terrific and we fell in love with our evening housekeeper -- she was a doll. Our breakfasts in the hotel restaurant were delicious and fast. The bedding and amenities were top-notch. My older son even said the sofa bed in the living room wasn't too bad. The one bad bump was with a conceierge -- Richard -- who, we found out after a $30 tip, was absolutely wrong on everything he told us. He said we couldn't get tickets for \"Wicked\" without a broker and that they'd cost \"$150 easy\"-- we walked into the theatre a block away and got front row balcony tickets for that night at $80 each.... He said take a bus to the museum campus as it was much cheaper than a taxi -- Wrong -- we took a cab because of a rainstorm and found that it was faster, easier and $3 cheaper! His restaurant tips were to big chains not to smaller local places.... He kept pushing Navy Pier, which everyone told us to avoid at all costs.... The other two concierge we talked to seemd fine tho' and gave us great directions.. Bottom line -- stay at the Monaco. And take an architectural boat tour!

So when I first walked in, I was a bit disappointed. The Hotel Monaco has the small rooms of an older hotel and I had hoped to stretch out in a bit more luxury. BUT, the staff and their courteous and prompt attention to detail, and the hotel's location quickly turned me around. Yes, our room was small, but it was clean, the bedding was elegant and comfortable, the shampoo and beauty products were wonderful (after this, I'm going to find them on-line to purchase them), the robes were comfy, and the bar was well-stocked. The Hotel Monaco is in a great location -- steps from shopping, dining, and entertainment on Michigan Avenue and State Street (it's just south of the river). We walked less than a block to dinner at McCormick and Schmick's (we LOVED it); got the bus around the corner to go to the Museum of Science and Industry and a few other places when it was raining; found a few spots nearby for a relaxing drink; and generally found the location to be as convenient as any (we typically stay at the Intercontinental, which is right on Michigan Avenue, but wanted to try something different this stay). Then there's the staff: from the moment we walked in the door, everyone greeted us with a \"hello\" or \"good morning\" or \"good night\" and a smile. The concierge was helpful. The bellhop was helpful and friendly. The first time the woman behind the front desk left her spot as I walked in the lobby and beat me to the elevator to push the buttons for me (both outside the elevator and in), I was impressed; I soon came to expect that kind of simple, extra attentiveness and courtesy from every staff member there. My husband is a very big man (6'4\", 250) and so we typically like our rooms large so he doesn't feel cramped. The Hotel Monaco made up for the small rooms with its very big heart.","date":"2015-03-08 06:22:52 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Evans Predovic","content":"My wife and I booked a room for four nights on Thanksgiving weekend and I am not suprised that this hotel has sunken in the TA rankings as of late. The location is fine and rooms are quiet enough but we had a few complaints. The biggest problem is that the windows don't open - not even a crack. The recycled air was very dry and made the room a little stuffy. The cleaning service (as mentioned in previous reviews) was not great - bed turndown was inconsistent and parts of the room seemed untouched. There was peeling and scratched wallpaper and the caulking around the bathtub was a little moldy and stained. The reception staff was inconsistent as well. The concierge service wasn't the most professional. Having said all this, I need to say that the rate I recieved from Hotwire was very reasonable. I find it hard to call this hotel substandard because compared with other downtown \"four-star\" establishments in Chicago, it was no different. However, the higher rates one pays when conventions are in town would have left us disappointed. I don't see any reason to choose this Kimpton over, say, the Hotel Intercontinental.","date":"2014-08-16 11:59:25 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":2,"Location":5,"Overall":3,"Rooms":3,"Service":3,"Value":4}},{"author":"Zetta Bode","content":"My power went out during last week's heatwave, so rather than sleep in the bathtub I got a room at the Hotel Monaco on Priceline.

Having lived in Chicago for 15 years, we wanted a hotel close to Michigan Ave and Near North for our kids, knowing they would love this area. The Omni's location really was perfect...Water Tower, Hancock, Navy Pier, Millenium Park, great food, museums, shopping, river, loop, etc. all located within walking distance. Upon checking in, the kids were given these cute little backpacks filled with activities and treats. They thought this was great and wore them for the next 2 days. At the check-in desk, I asked about a room with a view. There wasn't one ready (and I didn't pay for one) but the clerk said it would be about an hour if I wanted to wait. He took my cell phone number to call me when it was ready. So we stored our luggage and walked down to Navy Pier for a boatride. Sure enough, within about 55 min the hotel called to let me know we could check in. The room was quite spacious for a downtown, city hotel room. A small living area with a sofa and tv, desk and bar area made up the first part. Through a set of double doors was a bedroom, also a decent size, with two double beds. The bathroom was nice as well and the closet had a lot of room. Went down to the pool, which was a bit of a dissapointment. It is a little small, but being a city hotel I can understand that. The three main issues I had were: 1) the temperature of the pool area was freezing! Everyone in there (I'd say 12-15 adults\/kids) were either in the pool, which was warmer than the air, or wrapped up in the pool towels for warmth. It was very uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all. 2) the hot tub wasn't on and wasn't filled. Considerng the temp of the air, this was even a bigger disappointment. At least 6 people came down to use the hot tub while we were there, only to be disappointed by its emptiness. 3) the pook deck itself is made of tile and is incredibly slippery when wet. Why in the world this kind of tile was chosen for the pool area is beyond me. Three people, including myself, almost wiped out. I was really worried the kids would fall and hit their heads. It really was poorly designed. When we got back from dinner, housekeeping had turned down our bed, replaced all of our towels (which we had used when we got back from the pool) and left milk and cookies. The kids were so thrilled with this little gesture. The last thing I'll report about is leaving something in our room. Unfortunately, after we checked out and were driving out of the city, we realized that our 4 year old's favorite stuffed animal had been left in the room. I called the hotel and was connected with Chris in security. He took my name and number and promised to call me back after looking for the stuffed animal. Within 10 minutes he had found the bunny, called me back and offered to FedEx it, on Omni's dime, to our home. It arrived today. I was very impressed with the Omni and will definitely return on our next visit. The service was excellent and their treatment of the young kids was really refreshing.","date":"2013-07-24 11:50:46 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Katelyn Conn","content":"This is a beautiful, well kept property in the heart of Michigan Avenue.

You get your choice of high floor\/low floor, near the elevator\/away from the elevator, and so much more.When I joined I received a 50% off coupon for a weekend stay. I also received another coupon for an upgrade. And, of course you receive the coffee, juice and newspaper delivered to your door in the morning at no charge.

Spacious. Very clean. Great view from 18th floor. There was a construction site right next door to the hotel but we never heard it. You really had to strain to look down to see it. Loved having two televisions so I did not have to watch sports highlights all morning with hubby;-) Free WiFi with select guest was priceless in helping to navigate our daily activities. Each morning we got two complimentary beverages and a newspaper of our choice. The king bed was really comfy. The bathroom was well equipped. Lots of toiletries, the extra towels we requested and great water pressure. Chairs were comfortable. Did not use the wet bar or mini bar but if we needed to it was well equipped. There were two sets of elevators to get to our room but we never had to wait more than one minute for an elevator. It felt like extra security. Staff was attentive but not smothering. Only complaint I have is that the temperature was difficult to regulate. In order for the room to stay cool the way we like it, we had to leave the fan on. The auto setting did not seem to work, or at least I couldn't work it. It is a minor complaint and is way over-shadowed by all the wonderful things.

We stayed about a week. I was tagging along on a business trip my boyfriend had. He checked in the night before I arrived. He left my name at the desk and I had no problem obtaining a key. The room is very comfortable and having the two rooms makes it nice when one person is a nightowl or gets up early to go to work. TVs in both rooms. DVD player in the living area (and a Blockbuster is about a block away). Bed was super comfy with high quality linens. We had a corner room (1717) and looked north and west. Not a great view but good light. We did have the mini bar key and used that refrig to store small things in. (There's a Trader Joe's three blocks away.) The entire staff was pleasant, efficient and professional. The concierge gave us some great ideas for dining and made reservations for us. The location is great, just off Michigan Ave. across from the Apple Store. The red line train is 3 blocks away at State and Chicago. We got a good rate: $159 during the week and $171 over the weekend nights. Good value for the quality. Sign up for their loyalty program and get free wifi and delivered coffee and juice in the morning. But skip their restaurant. It's nothing special and there's lots in the area. Also the business center charged $6.95 per 15 minutes to use the internet (although you could print airline boarding passes for free). I just waited until BF got back with his laptop. Finally, sign up for a Chicago Greeter. I had a great 4 hour walkabout and saw things and explored neighborhoods I'd never been to before.","date":"2013-01-08 14:16:57 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Gennaro Lakin","content":"We stayed at this hotel in December of '07 via an American Express promotion for a great price.

On the other hand, the Omni is both the noisiest and dustiest hotel I have ever stayed in. It apparently is located directly on the hospital route...ambulances screamed by at all hours of the day and night. One night there was a weird drumming (I am was on the 11th floor) that lasted about 90 minutes; during the day there was lots of drilling noise, which presumably will go away once the reno is finished. The upside of the noise was that it provided unexpected entertainment--sitting on the toilet, with a vent directly above, it is possible to hear every single word of the conversations taking place in an adjacent room. An eavesdropper's delight! Aside from the noise, the hotel was dusty--everywhere. In my room; in the conference meetings room; the the bar; in the business center--in short, every facility I used at this hotel needed a thorough cleaning. When I checked into my room, I opened the curtain behind the bed, and to my disgust, it seemed as if every previous tenant of the room had left his or her hand, nose or lip print on the window. It was so gross I asked housekeeping to clean it up--which to their credit they did promptly. What others have said about the weird layout of the rooms was true for me, although it was not a major inconvenience or distraction. It did seem odd, though, that there was no light switch in the bathroom adjacent to the entry door from the bedroom side of the suite. The location of this hotel is superb, and it's fine for what it is--a fair-to-middlin' hotel. It is not four-star and it is not luxe, but it gets the job done.","date":"2012-04-25 02:33:29 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":2,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":2,"Location":5,"Overall":3,"Rooms":3,"Service":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Christiana Vandervort","content":"First of all, although they confirmed adjoining suites, when we checked in, they didn't adjoin.

It is an all suite hotel and I had one of the basic ones (called a deluxe king suite I think). I got a good rate for the dates and star level through hotwire so I was a little concerned, but I needn't have been. It is absolutely clean. It is very roomy with deluxe bedding, upscale designed wood, marble and granite everywhere. Plasma TV in the sitting room and another TV in the bedroom, free wifi. It was very roomy. Great Wolfgang Puck coffee in the room. A CD player in the alarm clock. Electronic temp control. Wetbar. I enjoyed the view from the 20th floor. The artwork in the elevator and lobby were probably done in China in a factory to look like real artwork (yuck). I thought the desk people were decent, but I felt there was a general lack of warmth and helpfulness that was so evident in my stay at the Hotel Indigo the night previous. It made me feel less than welcome, so the \"shwank\" was wasted on me. I did like the conveniences. Valet parking is 40.00 a night so ask about self park, it is just around the corner under some shopping mall (I can't for the life of me remember what it was called) for 28.00 a night. It is valet too, just not from right in front of the hotel. Great location if you want to do the shops on Mag Mile. Short bus or cab rid to other downtown sights like the Art Institute or King Tut (Field Museum). I didn't have time to check out the resturants, but there have to be so many really good ones nearby, it's Michigan Ave. There are sirens and other loud street noises as you might expect dowtown, but I was able to sleep with earplugs.

She had heard great things about the Omni, so we decided to stay there in November 2005. The Omni Chicago is located right on Michigan avenue, which was great, because we could just walk ouside the hotel and immediately enjoy walking the Magnificent Mile. From the moment we pulled our rental car up the hotel, the bell staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. Surprisingly, they were the ones that demonstrated what customer service should be. When we got inside the hotel to check in, we experienced the complete opposite. We patiently waited for someone to acknowledge us. No one else was standing in front of us. This lady behind the desk looked up at us, didn't say a word then continued what she was doing. She could have said, \"I'll be right with you.\" We didn't mind waiting, but some sort of acknowledgement would have been nice. Finally, she looks up, puts out her hand (as if to motion us to come) and still doesn't say a word. I'm surprised she didn't whistle and pet us once we approached the desk. No \"Welcome\" or \"Hello\" or anything! She was downright rude and made us feel like we didn't deserve to be there. (We're in our 20's, are young professionals who were raised with excellent manners, and came dressed nicely--not in anything inappropriate). I guess because we didn't look rich or established to her, we didn't deserve any bit of service. After she checked us in, she gave us our room keys, and again, didn't say a word. She never pointed out where the elevators were, so we had to search for them. That was the only bad experience. The room we had was very nice, chic and modern with warm colors. The view is typical of a city view...lots of buildings. There was a large bedroom, a sitting area with a desk and a moderate sized bathroom. The beds were very comfy. I really liked all the rooms except for the bathroom...it was dim and didn't seem to fit with the room, because it wasn't that nice and looked like any other bathroom at a Holiday Inn. The restaurant is average. However, the room service is excellent and the food delicious...definitely as if we were dining in an upscale restaurant. The desserts were also very good. In summary, it's a great place to stay if you want to be close to all the shops and restaurants on Michigan Avenue. The bell desk staff should teach the front desk staff how to be professional and welcoming. They deserve the highest praise and made up for the rude front desk person.","date":"2012-07-08 16:28:22 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":3,"Value":3}},{"author":"Titus Wisozk","content":"staying in chicago is not cheap, so the least you expect is decent service. the omni excels in this respect - everyone was effortlessly competent and friendly. yes, the two stage lift is a bit of a nuisance, but you don't wait long. location is great, particularly if your partner is an Apple addict. comfy bed and, hurrah, plenty of storage in the bathroom - how often have you struggled to find somewhere to balance your washbag? on the downside, the fitness facilities aren't up to much and the wi-fi coverage was patchy. for classy cocktails before dinner, try the bar at the Park Hyatt.","date":"2014-06-12 17:02:02 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Value":3}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":null,"vacancy":true}

The tracks are very close to the hotel. This is not the hotel's fault but if you are on that side of the hotel it may disturb you. Seems they run more frequently during the day but it's something worth checking out. For sure if you are on that side of the hotel request a high floor so you are not literally next to the train. There is no shelf space in the bathroom if that is important to you. The sink takes up most of the counter and there is no additional shelving. There is a small glass shelf about the size of a couple of postcards on the wall but that was very loose and unstable in the room I was in. The bathroom door would not remain open so I propped it open with an ottoman and put a towel on top of that and used it for additional space to lay items.

In contrast, the Palmer House has excellent staff, all pleasant and responsive including the housekeepers, doormen, etc. The food is the standard Hilton fare (somewhat overpriced) but there is a Starbucks on the lower level, and right on the corner are places for breakfast and lunch. The rooms, however, are way below what one would expect from a standard business hotel of modest price. For instance, there were bedside tables on each side of the bed, but a lamp on only one side (so if two people were in the room, and the one by the lamp wanted to go to sleep earlier, the other would have to get into bed in the dark). THe desk chair could not be adjusted regarding height. There was not enough lighting in the room (partly because of what might have been high efficiency bulbs, but some gave off that harsh, greyish light). The closet was small and the door would not stay open and the ironing board hanging on the door kept banging everytime one moved the door.

I was there about 5 years ago and was booked at the Palmer House but it was overbooked and I was sent to another Hilton Hotel. The lobby is gorgeous! It is so vast and beautiful I thought I was in a palace. When I went to my room I thought I was in a prison cell. I was on the 15th floor. When you went into my room you walked about 3 steps and you were at the bed. It was so close to the hall (that was noisy) that I thought I was sleeping in the hall. When you were at the end of the bed there were 2 large wooden doors. One was the bathroom. The bathroom door could not open if you had the room door open since they were so close. The bathroom was tiny. The other door opened to a closet (or a very small square box). Again tiny. Outside of the window was a fire escape that obstruted any view you might have had. I guess the real disappointment was there were none of the amenities I have grown accustomed to when I stay at a hotel. No bottled water, no coffe\/tea maker. Nothing! Next conference in Chicago I will be staying at another hotel.","date":"2015-10-26 22:04:20 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":4,"Overall":3,"Rooms":2,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":1,"Value":2}},{"author":"Herman Boehm","content":"This hotel was ideally located, and beautiful inside.

Upon arrival we were greeted by a Valet, who spoke very broken English. He asked if we needed assistance with our luggage to which we answered yes, he proceeded to give us our ticket and said we were all set. We then stepped in to a very impressive lobby (which is all that was impressive in this hotel) and waited in a long line to check in. The front desk clerk acknowledged that we booked through Priceline and assigned us a room, whcih was to have a been a room to accommodate 2 adults. We then entered a very TINY room that consisted of about 120 sq feet and a single bed. We promptly realized that this would not be acceptable accommodations for two people, as guaranteed by priceline, and returned to the front desk. At the desk we were informed that there are no guarantees when booking through Priceline, that we pay less than their other guests, therefore the rooms are assigned to the full paying guests and Priceline customers get the remaining rooms. After some argument we were able to be assigned another room. This room was slightly larger in size and included a \"Queen bed\" a little room to walk around it and a very small bathroom. There was construction outside of our room. The room had peeling wallpaper in multiple areas and was very dated with an old tube television and dated bathroom fixtures. It did not meet my expectation when I think of a \"4-Star\" hotel. The hotel did provide a 15x25 foot pool to accommodate it's over 1,000 rooms. It had a fee to use it's fitness room, a fee to use it's wired internet (as there was no Wi-Fi available)and we were not able to use the concierge due to an extensive line, therefore we chose to fend for ourselves rather than spend hours in line. Our luggage never did make it to our room, we had to contact valet and were escorted through the parking garage to retrieve our luggage ourselves. I would not recommend staying at this hotel to anyone and would not return to it. The time we spent outside of the room was very enjoyable and Rock Of Ages was great!

In this regard, don't let the title \"continental breakfast\" fool you. It included hot and cold cereals, cold cuts, a broad assortment of rolls, coffee and teas.

Our request of 2 beds and non-smoking room was submitted to the hotel and we were assured every effort would be made. We arrived approx 2.30pm and were told the room would be ready in an hour. 5pm came and went and still no room. In fact, we were put in an 'Apollo' room which is a huge suite, like a living soom, with seperate bed ROOMS doored on each end--which were locked as they were each booked; hence no beds. It was at least another hour to procure 3 rollaway beds as well as track down our checked in luggage. The beds were sleepable once we stripped the furniture of it's cushions and placed them to serve as box springs. 2 beds arrived with no pillows or blankets. Suffice to say all of our Saturday afternoon\/evening was spent trying to make a 5 star hotel room inhabitable. We were given a $50 food credit and explaination about them being totally booked for our trouble, but one night of bad beds, tiny bathroom and no mirrors to dress in front of was more than enough. By the time the dust settled we found that no food was available in the hotel--only drinks in vending machines. So I was sent across the street to a 7Eleven in the rain to gather sundries for my kids. We were assured of getting a 'real' room the next day which thankfully we did first thing in the morning. We lugged everything to a floor above and thankfully had 2 beds and a long mirror. The beds and bedding were fabulous. I likened the first night to staying in a museum and sleeping in the warehouse. A year ago we stayed at the Chicago Hilton and everything about that hotel was head and shoulders over our experience here. The bed and bath shop in the Palmer just off Monroe is a saving grace, however. Wonderful staff and products that contributed to my restraint of hostage taking. Breakfast buffet, which is a traditionally sumptious affair, was markedly disappointing both in quality and selection. I got the impression that this hotel has been tripping over dusty laurels for decades. I LOVE the classic old glamour of hotels but this stay illustrated a lack of cohesion. Chicago Hilton seems to know what makes a 5 star truly that. Palmer House seems to spend the most energy remembering when it was--which in my book knocks it down to a 3.","date":"2015-09-10 01:58:31 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":3,"Overall":3,"Rooms":3,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":3}},{"author":"Alfredo Goldner","content":"Stayed 2 nights for business because other choices with a shuttle bus to my conference were sold out.

The check-in was efficient and friendly. We got to our room - no mini bar. That drives me crazy, personally. Not that I ever use it, but we do like to stuff our leftovers in the fridge! I was not going to pay for a fridge to come to the room. Also - no free internet. I may be crazy, but as a silver HHonors member I believe I had free internet before. You can go to a Hampton and get it - why not the Palmer house? Ugh. The room was nice. Small, but nice. Bed was comfy, they usually are at Hilton properties. The bartender in the executive lounge had no clue on how to make a martini with a lemon twist - my husband ended up with a lime after she asked if he wanted olives. One evening we stopped at the lobby bar, Potter's, for drinks before going to bed, and the bartender had no idea what I was asking for - a wine that was on their somewhat limited by the glass list. I had to point it out. Also - for whatever reason they were not allowing carry out of food that evening. And they were a bit abrupt telling people about it. We had our drink and went upstairs where we had a bottle of wine waiting. When it was time to check out I called the bell desk to have them get our bags - we were going to do some shopping before leaving the city. I was asked (also abruptly) \"are you ready?\". NO. I always call the bell desk when I'm not ready. Then he went to the wrong room. He had to go back downstairs and find out where he was supposed to be going. When we came back for our bags I was told that I couldn't have them until my husband was in front of the hotel with the car. OK. So when he got there, there was a huge line. I finally got my turn, and the bellman who had my luggage moved so s-l-o-w-l-y that I almost grabbed the cart myself. Then he just stood there and let my husband load the car! Ugh.

The location is near-perfect, on the eastern edge of the Loop across from the Art Institute, two long blocks from Lake Michigan. The architecture is big, bold and old, but with ten times the character of some soulless glass tower. The service ethic is top-notch. And rates via Hilton.com are usually surprisingly good. During our stay amid the July 2011 heat wave, a cooler full of complimentary ice cream novelties greeted sun-baked arrivals to the check-in desks -- one of countless thoughtful touches. On Saturday afternoon at Lockwood, the long bar in the lobby, pooped tourists in $@!#%-flops poured down beer and lemonade passed across the cool marble by impeccable bartenders. In New York or Paris there might be some quacking about a dress code. Here, somehow, among the overstuffed leather furniture and the painted, brass and woven peacocks that comprise the Palmer's motif, it all works: relaxed, tolerant, and endlessly friendly. Our room was big and beautifully appointed with numerous updates, including new luxe bathroom fixtures and strong water pressure (often a concern in older properties) and unstoppable AC. About 40 percent of rooms have no view, though -- they face an interior air shaft. Ask if you want one. And for Hilton HHonors elites, there's a big, comfortable lounge on the 23rd floor serving snacks and drinks all day. The Palmer House is the perfect base for Chicago touring, family reunions, business, you name it. Everyone is welcome, and everyone fits in. it's only a little more than the nondescript Hampton Inn in the next block, and it makes any visit to this great town more memorable.","date":"2015-01-06 23:52:15 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Melissa Rutherford","content":"Chose this hotel based on reviews.. I was taking my daughter to school(freshman year) and decided this would be the right place based on it's location. the room was small but clean the bed was comfy too.. Hilton does need to stop charging for every little thing such as the high priced internet(20 bucks) and the extremely high self parking I paid more for parking than the full sized rental I had (38 bucks a day) and on top of that the Starbucks in the hotel that normally offers free wi-fi didnt have it either.. the food was costly but thats ok We went to the cafe bakery on the corner and ate breakfast... (get the blueberry muffins but go early)And there are plenty of great restaurants to eat in, other than the hotel.... Otherwise the hotel is close to everything... good shopping on State and of couse Michigan Ave... lively people watching on Wabash... Close to public transportation because if I did not have to have a car to move my daughters stuff... I would definitely take public transportation.... the traffic in Chicago is RIDICULOUS!!! worst than D.C and NYC!! I love Chicago!!!

She's played hostess to presidents and the well off and beautiful. She's earned her place in the sun. Still, like many of her kind, the years haven't necessarily been kind. While glimpses of her former beauty and personality still shine through, her features have slackened and become somewhat unrecognizable through the years. Her main lobby, complete with dramatic staircases, more often resembles the chaotic terminal of an airport, than an elegant and serene foyer in which to relax with a pot of afternoon tea and pastries. In the three days I was in residence there, there was virtually no time - save very late in the evening - when this lovely area wasn't besieged with families of travelers and their resulting luggage. It seems as though the hotel might choose to find another location that their arriving and departing guests might lounge with suitcases, rather than the elegant, main lobby\/tea room. The rooms, (at least our room was), in good repair, clean, and reasonably attractively furnished. The view wasn't outstanding, but I rarely blame an urban hotel for that. Everyone can't have the best view, and that is an acceptable point. The bathroom, while clean and adequately furnished, was very small. Subsequently, it was very crowded for my my own, as well as my husband's, toiletries to fit on the small shelf over the sink. The shower was fine. This was not a four or five star hotel in my opinion, but likewise, we didn't pay four or five star prices, either. The interior hallways leading to the bedrooms need a little attention. The wallpaper is peeling in places, and lends a dingy feel of neglected grandeur. Room service was delivered on more than one occasion, and the hotel was notably quick with their delivery - both times in less than half an hour. The restaurant, as well as the more casual bar, were both very pleasant experiences. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant every morning. The buffet was more than adequate, but in addition to this - any person paying for the buffet had the opportunity to order off the menu as well at no additional charge. For example, if a person would prefer an omelette or Eggs Benedict rather than the scrambled eggs offered in the buffet line, this option was readily made possible for the guest. I travel frequently, and I'm not aware of any other hotels with this nice offer. Dinner in the same restaurant was fine also, but not inexpensive. We tried a pre-fix menu of three courses paired with three different beers. It was an interesting concept, but the dinner wasn't anything especially noteworthy. The location was convenient to most major attractions, and of course that is a huge boon for those vacationers interested in seeing the sights in and around the downtown area. Many tours leave directly out of this hotel, as well. All in all, the hotel was a good choice for those desiring a reasonably priced, nice place to hang their hat while sightseeing or otherwise spending time in downtown Chicago.","date":"2014-04-12 17:07:22 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":4,"Overall":3,"Rooms":3,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":3}},{"author":"Hildegard Feeney DDS","content":"my husband & I spent 5 days here to celebrate our 45th anniversary.

As far as the developed world goes this is up there with the worst managed hotel. Not the worst hotel, it has a beautiful lobby, nice people but the worst managed. So if you get your room cheap - which means under $130 a night you might want to stay here. Otherwise you will not get what you pay for. First impression, 18 minutes in the Hilton Honors line to check in at 8PM on a Saturday night. Imagine what it is like on Monday. First room 12X15 and this is in an upgraded room I measured. The others are smaller. No toilet paper, no tissues, all of the lamps unplugged, pealing wall paper and pealing plaster in the spaces between the wall paper. Then the pipes began to scream and bang. Called the desk asked to send up an engineer they sent a security guard for the screaming. Explained the issue called the desk, they said there was no problem. Started again 30 minutes later so I held up the phone this time and they said they could hear it through the phone but would send a plumber. He came said of course he knew it happened it was old pipes. Called the desk a fourth time put him on and they said the onl king room was on the executive floor but I would have to pay for. I said fine. Went to put my suit in the closet. This is not a lie the closet was narrower than my coat hanger. Then went to use the TV. Did not work they sent a repair person. Then went to use the wireless. They said you need to come down to the front desk - waited 15 minutes - to get an old bridge, leave a $200 deposit, went back plugged it in nothing. Wireless only works with a bridge, get one when you check in. Called down the sixth time in 12 hours and they did not have any engineers working Sunday sent a bellman with a new bridge. The internet did not work in the room because the plug was torn out from the wall. Called down a 7th time in 12.5 hours and they said they would find me another king. They would find me a work room in the mean time. Sent a bellman he told me he was there to move me to a single - the old 12X16. I said no. I took the key went here and now am online and decided to write. Can't wait for the next 3.5 days. Check your room before you agree to make sure it is OK. BTW when I complained around call number 5 the desk person said they were sorry they did not know how the hotel had 4 stars when the Hampton Inn around the corner was better set up with better rooms and services. Another desk person said they have been complaining for years but Hilton will not put any money into the hotel.

It is a block from the art museum, park on the lake and very close to most major downtown theatres, greek town, and the Golden Mile. It is a grand beautiful old hotel with a magnificent lobby. The service is fantastic. Philippe at the concierge desk couldnâ€™t have been more helpful, and my check in attendant was equally wonderful. The rooms could use upgrading to join the rest of the hotels in the 21st century, like flat screen tv's and wireless telephones. The room was great. Although, I must say, in our party of three, the sizes of the rooms varies, so ask for a big room. One of our party was in a room so small they could barely get their suitcase in, but my room was huge, with a hallway to the bathroom. As a Hilton Honors member, I received free internet discounted gym entrance and the opportunity to partake of the free breakfast and happy hour snacks every day. I am HH Gold. The room was nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. The TV is not even a flat screen old style. It is a relic, and sat far from my bed, making it tough to see. There was no coffee maker, but they are available upon request. The room safe was big enough for the largest of computers. There are very nice amenities in the bathroom. Water pressure was perfect and the water was hot. The downside of this hotel is the extra charge situation. Everything costs extra. There is no mini-bar because they want you to order from room service. Coffee is $8 plus $2 delivery charge and 21% service charge, plus tax. The gym is $10, internet starts at $14.99 for a few hours and $19.99 for a day. A scotch in the bar was $17 with tax and tip. There are plenty of places to eat in the neighborhood like Au Bon Pain which has a great lunch. You can watch your favorite TV show if you missed its initial run for $4.99 and movies are available at a much higher cost. I highly recommend the Palmer House Hilton.

The 'el' was so close to the hotel, you can hear it. It's fine once you get used to it, but needs a little adjustment before you do. Our room was lovely, mainly I think because we had a corner room which made it light and airy, with a view down to the lake. Also, because we had two beds, whihc meant it was reasonably sized. We heard a lady in the elevator complaining about the size of here room and when we went past a room beign serived and could see inside it, it did seem quite small. The bathroom was good with great products, the bedding was lovely and the location was fabulous. Most things were well within walking distance. There are plenty of places to eat close by, so no need to starve here. Our complaints were around the lack of... no kettle for tea or coffee making in the room. Why? And wifi was available, but at the most rediculous prices! It was something like Â£14.99 for basic (good enough to check your emails) a DAY or Â£19.99 for the faster stuff. As my cousin said - how come most of the coffee shops provide free access while you sip your $2 coffee, yet hotels charging huge amounts of money can't offer the same service? I'd advise you to go for a coffee to check your emails! Our other complaint was about the pool area. the pool is TINY, no changing facilities and the jaccussi was out of order for our whole trip, which was rubbish. We were really looking forward to a nice soak after a lot of walking and were hugely disappointed that it wasn't in working order. That aside though, we had a nice visit. The hotel lobby is as amazing as everyone says - but all manner of people can wander in and out of the area unchallenged, so make sure you lock everything up okay. We recomend the gage, which is on Michigan Avenue for a lovely meal. And finally, you can print your boarding passes out in the buisness centre for free :) The rest of the internet charges are high in there, but it was great to be able to pop in and print off my boarding pass with no hassle at all.","date":"2014-05-15 02:32:36 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":3}},{"author":"Dimitri Krajcik","content":"Whenever I travel to Chicago, I stay at the Palmer House if at all possible.

I had booked a pretty cheap rate (it was under $200) and after reading on here that some of the rooms were quite small, I decided to try for the e-upgrade that the Hilton offers in their email confirmations. The one I ended up with was on one of the two executive level floors, and I paid $35.00 a night for the upgrade, which I believe was well worth it. When I checked in I was a little taken aback by the long check-in line, but it moved very quickly. The person checking me in didn't mention my e-upgrade request, so I asked about it and he checked around and found me a room on the 22nd floor. I liked staying on the executive level. It had dedicated elevators, and what elevators they were! They were very old-fashioned, and had an upholstered leather bench to sit on in case you got weary on your ride up. My room itself was very good-sized, it had two double beds and a sitting area with a TV and a comfortable but very worn easy chair, a chair and desk and two tiny bathrooms. I have to say though, I literally laughed out loud when I walked in the room because the interior design was so old-fashioned. The beds were covered with elaborate, tapestry-like covers and the elaborate draperies looked like they came from Marie Antoinette's boudoir. I did check out the hospitality suite on the 23rd floor that was for the executive level guests one night, and it was quite impressive. They had a full bar (non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary) and an amazing spread of hot and cold snacks, including things like cheese and crackers, eggrolls, hummis, etc. I ordered room service a few times and it always came around the time they said it would. I would say the room-service food at this hotel was a cut-above the fare you usually get at this type of hotel. My favorite part of staying here was the lobby, it was just breathtaking, and I don't think I ever walked through it without a big smile on my face. I had lunch in the restaurant just off the lobby one day and really enjoyed it. This hotel seems to be the hub of a lot of activity in Chicago. One day I walked outside to see a huge police presence, and found out that former President Clinton was speaking at a fundraiser at the hotel that day. I later passed the concierge desk and overheard the concierge assisting a guest with getting tickets to an event the First Lady was holding there in the future. Overall I fully enjoyed staying here, but it's not for everyone. I can think of a few close friends who I would never recommend this place to, because they prefer modern W-type hotels.

We entered the lobby late Friday night and were met with loud hip-hop music being played. I actually walked around looking for the entrance to the club that I thought was off of the lobby until I realized it was being played through the house speakers! The lobby environment left a lot to be desired, I'll leave it at that. Our room consisted of a double bed, 3 feet from the door and about 10 square feet of walking space after you account for the huge desk and dresser (which should not be in that room to account for the minimal space). Not only was the room TINY for 2 people, but it was also right off of the elevator lobby, and with the bed being 3 feet from the door, I was able to share in everyone's conversations as they exited\/entered the elevator bank. The toilet that ran all night I'll chalk up to a small maintenance problem and these things just happen. Completely disappointed with the room, we headed down to the lobby for a drink. We watched the waiter pass us 3 times as he serviced the tables around us so my fiance walked up to the bar to get drinks himself. Paying $33 for 2 martinis (tip not included) was a little ridiculous but we figured those are downtown prices if only a bit inflated. If you decide to drive to the hotel, expect to pay $38\/night for parking in the lot across the street from the hotel. There is no validation, this is the price the lot charges and the exact same price the hotel charges, so don't forget to include that in the room cost. We parked at the lot on Clark and Harrison the second night -walking distance and $8 for the night- after having learned our lesson and paying $32 for parking the first night, and were lucky enough to find free street parking the next day on Wabash and Jackson (beware of the \"pay to park\" meters that charge $4.25 for 1 hour of parking). Fitness center is $10 to use and don't expect anything by way of free water or anything else because everything they have to offer, they've put a price on. I should say that they did change our room after we complained about the noise\/location\/size to a normal sized room with a queen size bed and space enough for two people, but I think at that point, the damage had been done and had I been able to change hotels without penalty, I definitely would have. The location of the hotel is great because you're within walking distance to most everything and a short cab ride away to everything else, but I would NOT recommend staying here again to anyone. For the price (room, taxes, parking, fitness, etc), you can stay at a much nicer hotel and I highly recommend staying elsewhere.","date":"2012-06-02 03:26:52 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":2,"Rooms":2,"Service":2,"Sleep Quality":1,"Value":1}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.radissonblu.co.uk\/hotel-birmingham","vacancy":false}

We took the L from Midway. The hotel is just steps away from the Adams St L stop. The Art Institute is about a block away. We used CTA buses to get around and it was very convenient to go to the museum complex and Navy Pier. The hotel lobby is beautiful. Our room was also very nice. The decor was lovely. They have some really cool lamps. We had a double room The room was a little small, but larger than I expected from reading reviews. I saw the interior of some of the single rooms as I passed in the hallway and they seemd to be very small. The bathroom was nice, very clean and appeared to be newly redecordated. We grabbed a quick breakfast at the Starbucks on the lower level of the hotel. There is a restaurant and lounge in the hotel, as well, but we didn't try those. We had Mother's day lunch at Miller's Pub which is on the corner by the hotel. The staff was very friendly, the service was good and so was the food. I highly recommend it. The down side at the hotel was the lack of any soundproofing. I was awakened in the middle of the night by a man's voice in the next room. I could hear every word just as clearly as if he had been in our room. We could also hear the L trains clearly from our room but that didn't bother me. It noticed it when II was awake, but it wasn't loud enough to wake me up.. The swimming pool was closed when we were there and they told us we could use the pool at the Hilton which they said was about 25 minutes away, which seemed silly to me. Overall we had a nice stay, the location was great, and we paid the $89 non-refundable rate, so it was a very good deal. There are a lot of other hotels in the area though, so I will probably try a different one next time and hopefully it will be quieter.","date":"2012-04-28 03:53:17 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":3,"Rooms":4,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":1,"Value":3}},{"author":"Oma Heaney","content":"we will always stay here when we go back to Chicago. wonderfull service everyone was very helpful. rooms were very nice, a little small and could tell a little dated but looked like they have started updating them. the web site needs to go more into the history of this hotel, it makes you want to go into every nook and cranny. just a wonderful hotel !","date":"2015-01-10 22:25:29 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Kelli Smitham","content":"The historic Palmer House has undergone a beautiful renovation, but it's hard to change the size of the rooms.

Got straight to the room, nice average hotel room with an amazing view of the ocean and all the happenings that go on around this hotel.

Beautiful beaches and so many fun things to do around this hotel , that I would stay again. My rooms were clean, the hotel was clean and I had great service the entire trip. Made a girls weekend great!! Tips for this hotel:: stay oceanfront, it is definitely worth the extra money. Also check out earlier than the 11:00am checkout. We waited for a long time for bell service and our car . I've heard we had over 200 rooms checking out at one time.

The website made the property look real nice, but in this case perception was not total reality. The lobby and reception area along with the conference facilities were nice and some had been redone\/renovated recently. We had a cabana room since we were travelling with little ones and needed the extra space. We got the rooms for the conference special price so it was in line with what we are used to paying for a room but I would not have paid \"retail\" for it. As for in room amenities, there were none. The TVs were older, no microwave, and the furniture a little dated. We had to pay $10 a night for a mini fridge. In it's heyday this was a jewel on Daytona Beach, and it still had some of its old glory but the shine had faded.. Being oceanfront by the boardwalk and next to the Ocean Walk Village was really cool. Having a place to sit outside in the evenings and chat and watch fireworks and listen to the band in the band-shell was neat too. I've stayed at less pricey hotels on the beach or near the beach (like across the street) that were way nicer for the money, even some with kitchens and true \"suite\" layouts. This property needs some updating\/modernizing to compete and regain its position. Hilton as a brand has a particular reputation and I am sure if Conrad Hilton were around to see this property he would not give it very high marks at all. Would I stay here again? Maybe, for a weekend getaway sans kiddos or if the muchkins are a little older and not in cribs and on formula. I still wouldn't pay full price though...and $20\/night to park is CRAZY if you pay \"retail\" for the room. Check that, it's crazy period. There's more I could say to be critical but I'll stop as I read some other review about conferences and elevators and I hate redundancy.","date":"2015-03-25 10:47:08 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":5,"Overall":3,"Rooms":3,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Ms. Wilber Hilll","content":"We got a very special deal on this hotel.

I was excited to be in Florida with warm and beautiful weather during my week stay! A few years ago I was invited to Daytona Beach to explore the possibility of bringing meetings to the area. At the time, the hotel was flagged as an Adam’s Mark. Several years ago it was rebranded to a Hilton. This is a very large hotel, located directly across Atlantic Avenue from the Ocean Center (convention center and arena), and Peabody Auditorium. The hotel itself can accommodate various size meetings. The hotel does not have shuttle service to\/from the airport but there are private companies and taxis that offer airport to hotel service for approximately $18. The airport is just minutes to the hotel. I was greeted by very professional and friendly staff at the HiltonHhonors line (no waiting in the other long lines) and was off to my room in the south tower in just a few minutes. I had breakfast coupons and everything I needed for my week in Florida. My room was two double beds as no king bedrooms were available, even with my gold Honors status. There was a large group at the hotel which no doubt used many of the rooms. My guest room was showing a need for a refresh, and a bit cramped with two beds. However, the spectacular and most incredible view of the beach and ocean quickly made up for any room needs. I enjoyed the mornings rising to beautiful sunrises, and the beach. The beds were very comfortable and typical Hilton beds. The bathroom was a bit small and compact but adequate. The one problem I encountered a few days was the terrible water pressure. Later in the week it seemed to improve. I must say the staff at this hotel is superb! They greet you in the public areas and ask if they can help you with anything, or will direct you to where you need to go. One afternoon I arrived back at my room and noticed it had not been cleaned. A quick call to the hotel guest services promptly resolved the issue. I was very impressed with the hotel staff; they are some of the best in the industry. I was very impressed with the front desk\/check-in staff and how helpful and friendly they were! Great people!! The breakfast coupons entitle one to the full buffet or you may order from the menu. The buffet was very good and offered the typical morning breakfast fare. Knowing I did not want or need to eat so much for breakfast each morning I opted for the menu selections on several days. The restaurant staff at “Doc Bale’s Grill” were top notch and very attentive! This venue is only open for breakfast from what I could tell. I must say the breakfast buffet seemed a bit on the high-price side at $19.95 per person. However, it does come with beverage choices and all-you-can-eat. Over all my stay was incredibly great! In fact, I had a hard time leaving! The weather, paired with being on the beach is just a bit of paradise! Other related comments about the Daytona Beach area. The Ocean Walk Village is located directly next to the Hilton, and is a complex of two hotels (including the Hilton and Wyndham) and shops. I must say this “shopping” complex is nothing more than a collection of fast-food style restaurants, with a couple retail shops. I was disappointed in what it had to offer. The shops along Atlantic Avenue are your typical beach\/surfing shops that cater to the tourists. If you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all as each offers the same basic line of “tourist trinkets” and clothing. If you are searching for anything in the line of local art\/craft\/photography, you are not going to find it along the beach area shops. Overall, my experience in Daytona Beach and at the Hilton was great! For a destination to relax and kickback, and enjoy the weather and beach, this is it! If you have a car, Orlando is just an hour away.","date":"2012-03-23 22:06:45 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.oakfieldbnb.com","vacancy":true}

Bottom line is that I was overcharged in a very misleading manner and when I took this up with management they were unwilling to do anything about it. The service was the worst I have ever received from any business that I have ever dealt with...no joke. One of the employees even threatened to call the police on my family and I.

I will say that the pools are great, especially for young kids however, for the price we ended up being charged we could've rented an oceanfront beach house (seriously, I looked into it).

The resort is great, our room was so nice it was right across from one of the pools and of course it was clean and comfortable. I understand what other reviewers mean about the televisions, but are you really there to watch tv?? I hope not because the Oasis water park is great. We loved the wave pool and the lazy river. My husband and 8 year old son used the water slides and enjoyed those as well. There was never a lack of tubes to use for the pool or river, and plenty of chairs around the water park to lay out during the day. We ordered lunch on the second day there from the Oasis grill, it was just ok, maybe we didn't get the right thing we ordered fries and shared a club wrap. Everyone we encountered was friendly, service was excellent. Our free breakfast with the deal was actually a credit for 26.78 per morning which can add up fast considering a cup of coffe is 4.95, but it's totally doable if you watch what you order. The lobby grill has a nice outdoor seating area and the food was great. We didn't use the spa. You can charge everything back to your room if you put a credit card down for incedentals. We paid cash.

Our ocean view room was hugely expensive at $400 but because of the price and reviews we were expecting something luxurious. It certainly wasn't. The view was great but the room and the hotel was very tired and needs updating. Our room was musty and the bathroom was tiny with the shower being something from the 70's. We had previously stayed in Las Vegas at $100 per night in a room bigger and better. The breakfast was fine but what a small and dingy room. The fitness centre was a joke. Not big enough to swing a cat in. Outside of the hotel is a toilet block so don't have a room on the left of the hotel as you will look out over it and the surrounding area is full of wooden shacks with quite a few homeless and young people partying. The staff were very pleasant but our stay was ruined as we felt the room was only worth max. $200. If you go here do not spend any more. I can't stress enough how it didn't meet our expectations.

We were very happy. While there was no restaurant onsite, we liked the free continental breakfast in the morning. We had lots to eat there. Plus there were drinks available there all day for free. Snacks and drinks were available by the heated outdoor pool. From 4-5 pm was a free wine hour. There were tons of restaurants nearby to chose from after our busy day.

There is a fabulous dining and shopping district right across the street. Pretty much anything you are in the mood for you can get within a 5 minute walk. Being a fairly young female and traveling alone, I am always careful of my surroundings. I felt safe walking around at night and being in the hotel alone. The hotel itself is nice. It is a simple hotel, nothing really fancy about it. But it is comfortable and clean. The rooms are very large! And comes with a full kitchen complete with a closet full of kitchen utensils and supplies. While my room only had a king, I felt as though with the right beds, you could comfortably sleep 4-5 people easily. The bathroom was nice and clean with a good amount of counter space. The hotel has a pool and hottub. I did not get the chance to go in, but I walked around it and saw people in there enjoying it. It has a good amount of parking underneath the hotel. The hotel served a wonderful breakfast with freshly made waffles, eggs, cereal, etc. The hotel staff was so wonderful and friendly. They were quick to help me when I got locked out of my room and had great recommendations for food and fun local places.

The hotel is extremely well located with easy freeway access, close proximity to Balboa Park, easy access to downtown and the airport, and within walking distance of a variety of good restaurants, CVS, and Whole Foods. We also wanted a hotel with cooking facilities for folks who prefer to eat in rather than going out for every meal. The kitchen is adequately furnished and the staff runs the dishwasher every day for you. The hotel is situated near a hospital and during the day you hear emergency vehicles but they are not a problem at night. Most rooms have had their windows treated to cut down on street noise since it is located on a busy road. Like any hotel you can get noisy neighbors but we only encountered that one night. (We have gotten where we always take a small sound machine with us that provides white noise and helps cover up most noise because it seems that noisy neighbors are found in many hotels.) We were driving mini vans and the parking spaces in the garage were a bit tight but then we found this to be true pretty much everywhere in San Diego where parking is at a premium. I felt the staff went the extra mile for us. They were painting the building while we were there and someone had taken the time to cover my car in a huge sheet of plastic so it wouldn't get paint on it. We're not talking a hotel that is ultra fancy but it's affordable, clean, comfortable (the beds are great), the rooms are large, the breakfast is comparable to most chain hotel breakfasts, it is very well located for exploring San Diego and we would definitely stay there again.","date":"2014-03-10 10:12:07 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Lea Schaefer","content":"Very similar to the last review....booked based on reviews, ranking, and location.

Upon walking to, and entering room, rating was falling... also noticed the old dirty carpet, and while technically a suite, it was very \" cozy \", but still acceptable. Where it lost more points was on the thin walls - from the noisy couple above us during the night, to the kids running down the halls in the morning, to the speaker right outside my window playing the lobby music all night ( which the clerk did turn off as soon as I mentioned it - after midnight ). A couple positives were the decent breakfast, again helped by the nice staff, and the central location - it was max 20 minutes ( usually 10 ) to where ever in the city we were going. The price was OK, and the overal cleanliness was OK, with the bad points mentioned plus little things, we would not stay there again, or recommend it to friends.","date":"2012-06-22 23:27:16 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Overall":3,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":2,"Value":3}},{"author":"Daphney Gislason","content":"I was in San Diego for a conference and we stayed here for 2 nights before moving to the conference hotel down by the harbor. We picked it based on the reviews here and I am so glad we did! This place is a gem. The staff were friendly and welcoming and the room was great-- very big and so comfortable (loved that bed!) Also clean and well stocked. As people have said, the free coffee and popcorn and chocolate are a great touch. The pool area was right outside my room but the noise wasn't bad, and it was a great place to relax and sunbathe, BBQ there too on Fridays. I saw someone wrote on here that it was in the shade-- yes it was, in the evening!! The breakfast included was also great--coffee, waffles, cereal, toast, bagels, juice. The breakfast area is quite small so we brought ours outside or to our rooms. Location is great, it's close enough to the airport and also to the downtown area. We walked straight down 5th avenue to the gaslamp district, through Balboa park, was great!! Also nearby are great food places, a 24 hour pharmacy, etc. The free wifi is also brilliant (and is not slow at all). The hospital thing wasn't a problem at all. I heard a few sirens but nothing I haven't heard before living in a city. Also the surrounding area felt safe I wasn't worried about walking around alone. I moved to the Sheraton Marina hotel-- a 4 star hotel-- and it is nowhere near as great as this place!! Here we are paying ridiculous prices just for a sea view and the breakfast and service is not as good. Definitely stay here you won't regret it, we didn't want to leave!

There is a park a short block away for walking the dog, doggie cookies are available, and strokes to friendly dogs are liberally applied. Parking is a downside in this facility, as the hotel offers only Valet Parking at $32 per day.Initially, I accessed the self park option in a parkade across the street, but ultimately opted for the valet option -- the staff were friendly, helpful, and prompt when I needed to access my vehicle. The lack of a charge for my pet and the exceptional breakfast offset, in my opinion, the fee for the parking. I stayed at this facility, as my dog was not accepted at the Kona Kai Resort, where I was attending a meeting. Being a senior was of benefit in establishing the rate I was charged.

It definitely is clean and the service was what I expected. But here is a list of my issues. 1. Booked a room with two double beds and requested a rollaway which was printed on my confirmation. Upgraded for $25 to bayview. At check in was told that rollaways were not permitted due to fire codes. Impossible for me and two teen boys to fit in the room we were given. Even though it was an upgrade, the room was so small, you could not walk around the beds, there was no door to the bathroom that you could close, only a pocket door that did not close. Windows were covered up in places with yellow tape, as if they were broken. Upon seeing the size of the room and the unavailability of the rollaway, I had to book another room. Funny thing is - in booking the new room - I got the cheapest room available at the time and it was much larger and nicer than the original room I booked (so my issue with the hotel, is what is the point of an upgraded room, what exactly did my upgrade pay for)...! By the way the cheaper room also had a bayview. Another point of contention, my friends stayed in a lower rate room and not only had more space, a bayview and a real bathroom door, but also received bathrobes, which I did not get). My suggestion is do not get the upgrade!! Another point of contention is the location. I think it is convenient in the sense that you can walk to just about anywhere you need to go, but I would not feel comfortable at night in that area, definitely as a woman with kids felt like I had to be hyper aware. I am used to the homeless, living and working in Boston, but the hotel seems to be in a very active homeless area. There is a lot of people asking for money, so just know this if you are going to stay here.

The bathroom was the best I've seen outside Tokyo and Seoul. Beyond the large area for the sink and toilet, the shower was in another alcove behind a glass door. There were multiple showers (2 shower heads on opposite walls and 3 body sprays near one of them), there was a tile bench along one wall that you could sit on while you took a shower if you chose the removable showerhead opposite the one with 3 body sprays. The bathroom was almost as large as the bedroom. The beds were also extremely comfortable. Service was immediate and friendly. The bath products were from Lather, and they smelled wonderful. I go to an annual convention in San Fran, and this is the first time I've stayed almost my entire time in the hotel- I took a couple long showers daily and read in bed all day.

We had a week in San Francisco for a convention and decided to take our two kids. That meant looking for a suite, so that we could put the kids to bed in one room and still stay up and watch TV and visit with friends in the other. The Kabuki had a variety of reasonably-priced suites that fit the bill, for just a bit more than a regular double room at the big-name convention hotel. (Note: the Kabuki's 'East-West' suite, with one Western bedroom and one Japanese tatami room, does not adequately isolate one room's sound from the other.) The 'Junior Suite' was great for our purposes. The kids had the big bed in their room while we had a foldaway futon in ours.The hotel is newly remodeled (it was the Miyako when I lived out there), and very comfortable. The staff seemed to be changing constantly, so it was hard to find a regular, 'go-to' person; however, everyone was professional and pleasant enough.Japantown is a nice part of the city, with plenty of (mostly Asian) dining options very close to the hotel. We found we could walk pretty much everywhere we wanted to go (we made the obligatory tourist trek up over Hyde Street to Fisherman's Wharf and even walked to the Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park). When we needed cabs, they were easy to find.The only drawbacks I can think of were the lack of any sort of bathrobes in the room -- a bit odd for a Japanese-style hotel -- and the rather slow wireless Internet. Also, refrigerators in the suites would be nice (NOT just for the idiotic mini-bar -- does anyone actually buy that overpriced $@!#%?) However, all in all, we would gladly go back, and we were very glad we opted for the Kabuki over the mega-chain conference hotel.","date":"2012-10-26 10:50:58 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":3,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Miss Annabel Lind","content":"Terrific Time!

We arrived in the pouring rain and were pleasantly greeted with sake and wine tasting before we even got to the front desk to check-in. When we checked in with Michael at the front desk, he upgraded our room when he found out we were celebrating our anniversary. Tomo refilled our glasses with sake and invited us to take our glasses with us to our room. Later that evening, Michael delivered more of the yummy sake and some delightful, tasty snacks as a nice anniversary treat. I jumped in for an enjoyable soak in the wonderful tub--the sake was a great complement to the bath! Then we enjoyed the lights of San Francisco in our corner room. The room was nicely furnished, and the Lather bath products were a nice touch. In the morn, we awoke to a beautiful sunrise sneaking over the buildings on the horizon. We had the weekend planned and took Michael up on his offer to help us with anything we needed--we wanted to take a bottle of the yummy sake home with us. Michael got us a bottle. We would highly recommend Hotel Kabuki. The price was right, the room was great, and the staff was awesome. Parking was good for a large city: we parked in the underground lot next to the hotel--very easy access and out of the continuous rain. We didn't spend near enough time in the hotel. And, we didn't take time to enjoy the Kabuki Spa, which we heard was great.

I thought this hotel would be much better based on the reviews. It's true that the lobby is spotless and when you're there it seems like it will be a great stay, but it seems like they gave, like, 75% effort on our stay. Some of the disappointments were:1. No ice bucket. Had to call downstairs and wait 15 minutes for one to be brought up. (Isn't there a checklist of some kind for the housekeeping staff?)2. Broken shower bracket meant I had to hold the shower thing by the handle the whole time. An almost relaxing shower.3. Sliding glass doors to balcony is shared with the room next door. Before you jump out of bed, swing the curtains open and say Good Morining San Francisco! be sure to check the folks from the room next door aren't looking into your room. Also, the balcony sliding doors where unlocked when we arrived which means if we hadn't checked, we'd have left all our stuff in there totally accessible by the next door neigbors via the shared balcony.4. Bare wall patch where they had done some repairs in our room, but not repaired enought to paint or paper over. Oh yea, very Zen spackle job there.5. Security Risk - although there is a sign when entering the hotel through the totally Public parking garage in the basement saying someone will have to buzz you into the hotel... we just parked, opened the door to the hotel and took the elevator directly to the 10th floor and our room! How can you ever trust a knock on the door for room service after that kind of a security hole in a major city?Anyway, this is a nice location and the lobby and decorating hint at superb service, but it's like the management is alseep at the switch, so you get good service only when a particular staff member feels like it... 75% of the time.","date":"2013-05-28 09:01:33 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":3,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":3,"Location":4,"Overall":3,"Rooms":2,"Service":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Giovanny Mraz","content":"Excellent stay!!

The same young lady, Julia, was at the desk and told me there were no rooms without the drilling available for our stay. I asked to speak to Matt the manager. She told me to go back to the room and he would call. A few minutes later Matt called and said there were no rooms that did not have the drilling and not to worry as it only goes from 10 am to 5 pm. I told him we would leave then and he said fine to go ahead and leave as he could not help us. There were no apologies and no attempts to solve the problem.No I am sorry let's try and work this out.

The hotel is well kept and the rooms are not fancy but are updated and quite comfortable. Every evening the cliff jumpers light torches on black rock and jump off into the water. Its nothing crazy but a nice little touch that makes you feel connected to a forgotten true Hawaiian spirit. Our room upon check-in was the last room along Black Rock and had a great view but awkward layout. The cable didn't work and they couldn't fix it so they moved us to a new room in which they upgraded us to a Jr. Suite. The room was huge and was really nice. The staff did a great job to make up for the inconvenience and we were very happy with their assistance. I am a Starwood Platinum member so that may have helped out with getting a room upgrade but it was very nice of them to offer an upgrade without me having to ask for it. Sometimes the large resorts do not recognize Platinum status as much as more business-travel oriented hotels but this resort was very accommodating. The only negative, and this is really picking here, is that the pool is kind of an awkward layout. It is quite narrow in places and feels a bit small despite its enormous length from end-to-end. There is plenty of room on the other side for a second pool and it would be nice to see even a smaller, adults only pool as main pool area can seem a bit crowded and overrun with energetic kids. Overall I would highly recommend this property for those looking for a true mega-resort feel in the heart of Ka'anapali. The property has tons of energy and really is a great location. The hotel is great for families with children both older and younger as there is no shortage of activities. It is also great for those who like the feel of being in a larger resort town as it is merely minutes away from Lahaina and there are tons of activities, shops, and restaurants in the area. For those looking for a quieter, romantic getaway I would say that this resort is not exactly geared towards you. I would have no problem returning to this hotel when I have kids.","date":"2014-01-10 04:29:01 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Ms. Hailee Hickle","content":"Just Arrived yesterday , but So far it is a dream come true !!

We stayed on the Southern end of the strip before and it was FAR to get to where 'the action' was. This time, we tried Harrah's...and for the price, it was perfect. I had a group of 18 people (9 rooms) and not one person complained. Everyone liked the hotel's location on the strip, comfort of the beds, and value. Only thing I will be leary of is the 24 hour buffet package that they sell....if you plan on staying close to those locations, watching the time closely (if eating is what you want to do), then this is for you....if you are, on the go type, this may not be your thing....they are STICKLERS when they say 24 hours....as we were standing in line for buffet when our's expired.....didn't honor it....spoke to managers and they all had same reply...\"no exceptions, it's 24 hours!\". So, stear clear of that...unless gambling and eating is the ONLY thing you do. (There are several buffets, at several hotels included...you just have to PLAN where you'll be for 'feeding time'.) Didn't work for us, but may work well for others.

I obtained a fabulous deal for flights and accommodation through Travel bag but it did involve 3 flights there and back! Not for the faint hearted. Having gotten such a good deal I was a little worried about the hotel standard. I have been to Las Vegas before so I knew Harrahs was in a good location and furthermore I checked previous comments on Tripadvisor about the hotel but quite frankly they did not do it justice. If you want five star do not even consider Harrahs but for a no frills four star this is your place! I booked a smoking room and when I arrived the Receptionist said she had none. I was about to complain when she offered a room with a balcony which you could smoke on - first tick for the hotel. The room was close to the lift ( without asking ) thus near the ice machine and soft drinks machine. Some might think this would be a noisy locale but we were not disturbed. Room had two large double beds, 37 inch LCD LG TV and a smaller one in the bathroom!!! The room was immaculately cleaned every day and extra towels left without having to ask. - big tick here! We were not overlooking the swimming pool nor the night club so no noise disturbance but in fact could see the Mirage hotel opposite and a great view of the mountains in the distance ( fantastic sunsets!) Looking down wasn't the best view - but who's looking down! Staff were friendly in all areas- quite frankly can't say enough about them especially as it was so busy and they still kept smiling! Loved the Oyster Bar, loved drinks in the pool - watch out for the cocktails in the Harrah cups - $17.00 a pop but you only need one; but beyond a doubt the best thing about Harrah's is the dueling piano bar. It is rocking from Thursday to Saturdays; still good on the other nights but not quite as busy. it closes at 2am so we would get there from 12 on wards. There are many places to go to in Las Vegas but loved coming back to the piano bar. When that is closed if you have any energy go to the night club outside the entrance to the hotel - another rocking place! Las Vegas has become more expensive over the time I have been going there but of course the free drinks at the slots and gambling tables can make a difference there and you can still eat cheap if you look around. But make Harrah's you base. Unless I win the lottery and thus go back & stay in the Wynn then Harrahs' will be my first choice every time!","date":"2012-12-12 17:07:09 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.classic.co.uk\/browse-holiday-cottages\/Cornwall--1.html","vacancy":true}

This was the general impression that we got from the hotel, it all looks a bit tired and when you compare it to some of the other newer resorts it really fails into insignificance. On the plus side though we did get a really cheap deal with Expedia for this hotel so we didn’t waste loads of money on it. There is also so much to do in Vegas that if you’re looking for somewhere just to sleep that is cheap then Harrah’s is an ok choice. The location is also really good as it’s right on the central strip, but with hindsight I would definitely prefer to pay a bit more and get a better standard of accommodation, particularly given how much choice there is in Vegas.","date":"2015-06-15 01:39:17 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":1,"Overall":2,"Rooms":1,"Service":2,"Value":2}},{"author":"Darian Medhurst","content":"We must've had the SAME room as you - because our room also overlooked the A\/C and generators!!

Check-in seemed to go fine, we parked our car in their garage, hauled all our luggage up to our room and... the key card wouldn't work! Very annoyed we kept trying but had no luck. I walked down the hall towards the elevator and was getting ready to call the front desk when a bell boy came down the hall. I told him we had just checked in and our card wasn't working. He said 'aw man, I hope it's not the battery' checked our paperwork that showed the room we were in, used his card to let us in and told us to just let the front desk know our cards weren't working, they must not of been activated properly. So we proceded to get ourselves all settled in, unpacked some of our toiletries, used the restroom, and hung out for awhile looking at brochures and relaxing. We were in there probably 30 mins and decided it was time to 'hit the strip'. But first we need to stop by the desk and get our cards activated, no big deal right? WRONG!!! We told the man at the desk the situation and that our key wouldn't work and he asked to see my paperwork and ID which I gave to him, and he asked if the room was in my name and I said yes. He then took out this little purple strip of paper that was in the folder with the room key and asked if we knew the womans name that was on it. We said no and we had no idea what that paper was even for and I thought the womans name on it was the lady that checked me in. He explained that no it should of been my name on it and it was very strange but somehow when I checked in I was handed the wrong paper. That was why our key wouldn't work is because we were going to the wrong room. We explained that we went to the room we were told to go to and how were we to know any different! After asking us if we had been in the room long and if we had touched much and we said yes we had laid on the beds and used the restroom, he still made us move to a different room! He said he was sorry but the room we went to was registered to the lady who's name was on the paperwork and we were supposed to be in room xxx so we were going to have to move! Not only that but because it was a 'security issue' security would have to open the room for us and we had to identify our luggage before we could get it. So he called security and told them to meet us up there, gave us corrct paperwork, apologized again, etc. We hurried back up to our original room assuming security would already be there, but no one was in sight. By now our patience was extremely thin and I found it inexcuseable to have to wait for security, I picked up the house phone in the hall and angrily explained the situation and was put on hold, then security finally decided to saunter on up so I hung up. Security proceeded to watch our every move while we gathered our belongings making us feel practically like criminals. The one guy thought it was very weird we had to move to another room and told us to talk to the manager cause it wasn't right how we were treated. We agreed so we did stop by the managers desk where he apologized and comped our first night's stay. Now all that would of been good and fine if the rest of our stay had gone well, the one night free did go a long way towards making up for all our aggravation although it still stunk to start our night off with such a bad start. However we continued to have a bad experience at this hotel! The first morning there we had just got up and my sister was taking a shower when suddenly this very loud, obnoxious alarm goes off. I called the front desk and told them there was this hideous alarm going off and she asked if we were smoking and I said no and she said she'd look into it. Then we opened the door and there was a maid in the room across from us and she said everything is fine it's nothing to worry about. Ok well that's good to know, however it still took them a good 10 minutes to turn the blasted thing off, it was horrible! Later that day we came back to our room in the afternoon to relax for a little while and I went to get some ice to drink ice water and their ice machine was broken! It may seem like a minor thing but it was just one more irritation. Then to top it all off you would expect after such a bad stay to at least get good cutoomer service while checking out, but oh no not at Harrah's! I was all prepared to compain about everything that went wrong but when the woman checking us out asked how our stay was and I replied 'not very good' she just said 'oh, not very good huh'. I couldn't believe it! A normal response would of been oh I'm so sorry what was the problem? not 'oh not very good'! Then when I got my receipt I couldn't tell what had been charged to my card so I said 'can I get a total on here' and she snapped at me 'it's right there plain as day!' Well no, it was not! It had a charge with a minus sign, a room charge, the buffet we ate at Rio and then another charge with a minus sign. At the bottom where it said total it said zero. There was no total on the bill! I wanted to make darn sure the bill was correct and our one night had been comped so I went over to the manager again but he was busy with another customer. So finally another guy asked if he could help us and he explained our bill but when I said the lady checking us out had been rude he didn't respond so we just got the heck out of there! I honestly have never had such a bad experience at a hotel in my life and even if I was offered a free stay there I would hesitate to return!","date":"2014-10-06 05:14:59 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Overall":1,"Rooms":3,"Service":1,"Value":3}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.bronrhiwhotel.co.uk","vacancy":false}

The TV offered only a dozen (mostly local) channels, but plenty of advertisements for Harrah's facilities. The bedside clock radio was inoperable. Not only was the room without a micro\/fridge, there was neither in-room coffee nor daily newspaper. Second, Harrah's food services were disappointing. The continental breakfast in the business center was attractive, but limited. Two meals (one breakfast, one lunch) were offered at The Range, both of which were far below expectations. The menu, presentation, and service were on par with typical cafeteria fare. The Chinese restaurant offered tasty dishes, however service was inexplicably slow, and the food chilled quickly after it was served. Third, the common areas of Harrah's were less than accommodating. There was no place to sit unless one was gambling, eating or drinking. There was no complementary coffee or paper, even at the front desk. Most disappointing was the lack of pool\/spa facilities. I was shocked that a resort with the renown of Harrah's didn't have a year around pool. The only positive comment I have for Harrah's is its central location on the strip.

One word of warning, the drinks are expensive but you are paying for the entertainment value as well! And there's no skimping on the alcohol either. I'm sure most alcoholic beverages were doubles at least! The only complaint I have is that the rooms are very noisy. We stayed in the Mardis Gras tower and we heard every noise down the hall and the surrounding rooms, toilets flushing, taps running, bodily sounds etc. But I did hear that the rooms in the Carnival tower were newer and much quieter.

The pool was nice, noting glamourous but they have misters to cool you off which was nice. The specialty drinks by the pool ran about $7.00 each (which is NOT a lot in veags ) but you actually got a decent amount of ALCOHOL in them (which is not usual in Vegas.)

Location is not an issue for us, after an evening down the really busy strip, people everywhere and getting pestered by people trying to force these cards in your hand we find it so relaxing to get out of that environment back to a nice relaxing atmosphere and comfortable hotel.

As an added bonus, we got a great rate ($100\/night including the resort fee!) for three rooms. That's where the excitement stopped. We had problems getting what we asked for (we are talking simple things like towels and ice), the pool was packed and ridiculously expensive with terrible service and rude people, and parking was awful. Check in was easy, however, with a baby, I needed a crib and a microwave brought to our room. When we got to our room, it was the furthest set of buildings in the hotel and a little worn out – could use some updating. I was told to use the refrigerator in the room, I’d have to empty the mini bar. When I went to empty it half of the bottles were open and half drank and never replaced. Gross --- not to mention I’m sure an extra charge to me. The crib came within an hour of check in without a hitch, but the microwave was a $25 charge, took 5 phone calls to get, and interrupted our baby's sleep by finally getting it at 9:15pm (11:15pm our local time) after we had been told they were out and we wouldn’t get one until the next day and were already in bed. To get ice in this hotel, you need to call food service, who then brings you a little container. You can’t take your ice bucket to get it yourself. When we asked the person who came if we could get more, he told us the first floor maid area had some if we wanted to go there to get it – of course this was after we had to tip the guy. In my parents’ room next door, they had the smoke detector going off in the middle of the night because of a dead battery. They called to get it fixed—the front desk sent an “engineer” who pulled the smoke detector off the wall and left the cord hanging. It was fixed two days after it was reported. We spent Saturday and half of Sunday at the Paradise pool. Our group is all early risers, so getting a chair wasn’t a problem, although it was for many around us. Our problem was they don’t start serving food at the pool until 11:30, and when they do, a cheeseburger is $18. A few people in our group ran to Safeway and brought back donuts for breakfast and sandwiches for lunch. We were a big group, so it would have been expensive to eat there. Upon bringing the donuts down to the pool, we were told that they served food in this area so carry-ins weren’t allowed. At 8:30 in the morning the line at the coffee shop was out the door and around the corner and the pool grill didn’t open for another 3 hours – give me a break, not to mention that it wasn’t posted anywhere because we looked. Our family is usually a pretty “go with the flow” kind of family, who gets along with anyone and doesn’t say much, which is why I felt compelled to write this review when we all felt strongly about our stay. The grounds are very pretty (which you see on your 20 minute walk from the parking garage), but we felt nickel and dimed the entire stay, the rooms could use updating, and the level of service we received was barely par level and certainly not what I was expecting from a place with the reputation of the Biltmore.","date":"2013-12-08 10:08:03 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":3,"Overall":2,"Rooms":3,"Service":2,"Value":2}},{"author":"Carolyn Schaefer","content":"Well I am writing this review from my room at the biltmore, and I have to say that the hotel is wonderful and beautifully maintained, and the service is top notch.

It is steps away from the cable car stop, starbucks, Sears restaurant, and just generally in the middle of everything.

We were able to check in earlier than the 3:00 p.m. check-in time and were given a complimentary bottle of champagne and a nice card wishing us a happy anniversary. Prior to booking the hotel, I read a lot about it, so I was aware that there was no air conditioning and to request a room at the back of the hotel, to avoid the noise of Powell Street. We were given Room 1509, a corner room at the top floor, in the back of the hotel. While the view wasn't spectacular by any means, we appreciated being able to keep both windows open without the noisiness of the street. The room was small, as expected, but with a large walk-in closet so that you could maximize what living space you do have by stowing your things away. The room was updated with newer decor, furnishings and electronics, but since it is an older hotel, it was only slightly rough around the edges (wall, window, older bathroom). The hotel offers a cute pillow menu, which we didn't take advantage of, unfortunately. The bed was a little stiff for my liking, but my husband had no problem with it in the least. There is an adjacent restaurant (which we never used) and a tiny bar where we shared a drink and watched a football game. The tour desk was helpful in providing us MUNI passes, information regarding booking a rental car (we decided against it in the end), maps and brochures for area attractions and securing a limo for the ride back to the hotel. The most important thing, however, was that it was very clean and comfortable and of course, in an excellent location off Union Square, near all the shopping and dining you could want and across the street from Starbucks (bonus!) and a few doors down from Walgreens (when your feet and back are dying for Advil after a whole day of climbing hilly streets). If you are looking for an affordable, clean, safe and centrally located hotel while staying in San Francisco, with a bit of old charm and a cute little ducky to perk up your bathroom, you cannot go wrong with the Chancellor Hotel.","date":"2012-06-05 06:48:07 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":5}},{"author":"Quincy Kautzer","content":"We enjoyed our stay at the Chancellor, the location was excellent.

It was a very busy weekend in SF, there was a marathon going on right across the street. Perhaps this explained the outrageous room charges! We have traveled extensively to NYC and other expensive cities, and never before have I felt so ripped off by a hotel room rate. Good: The Chancellor is in a great location right at Union Square. There is loads of shopping, you can walk to the Ferry Building, lots of public transport nearby. Not so good: The Chancellor has been \"renovated\" but still felt dingy, especially the bathroom, which felt downright old. Although the linens and comforter were nice, the bed was lumpy. Bad: No air conditioner. I know this is made clear on their website, and I thought it would be ok, seeing how SF gets into the 50's at night. However, the windows only open about 6 inches (there is a safety mechanism so they won't open further), so there is really no fresh air in the room. The fan only circulates the hot air that is already in the room. Thus, at night, the room didn't cool down at all and was uncomfortably hot and stuffy, I would not stay here again, unless the room rate was 150 or less. The coffee is nice, but if the hotel really wanted to be standout, they might consider offering some sort of breakfast.","date":"2014-04-05 15:50:26 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":2,"Location":5,"Overall":2,"Rooms":2,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":1,"Value":1}},{"author":"Hellen Crist","content":"We stayed here for 3 nights on our California \/ Nevada road trip...

I picked this hotel from the fantastic reviews from other travellers in Tripadvisor. There is no regrets thereafter. From the moment I started making reservations, the manager, Wes Tyler has been very very very helpful. As we have driven in from LA, we had done a lot of shopping along the way and one of the purchase was a Tumi luggage which we have ordered in Carmel and to be delivered to Chancellor in SF. So i wrote to the hotel informing them that this luggage might be delivered even before our arrival. One of the reservation officers Kevin Vossen responded to my mail and said he has contacted Tumi and has been told the luggage will arrive in a few days time. It is really nice of him to take the initiative. They also took good care of our luggage when we were away for a few days (we went to vegas). And during those few days during our absence, the stuffs we ordered from Amazon were delivered to the hotel and were delivered to our rooms the moment we came back. There are several big hotels around Chancellor but I love the personal attention given by small boutique hotels. The rooms are beautifully furnished. The bed is very very comfortable and they also has a pillow menu. When we checked in, there was a bottle of champagne and a box of chocolates welcoming our arrival. On the second checked-in, there was a photo frame, with a bottle of champagne too. The frame is a very nice momento from the hotel and It is now sitting on top of my study desk :) The location is fantastic, right in the middle of Union Square and within 10mins walk to Chinatown. Taking the cable car was no hassle at all and all there are tons of shops like Macy's, H&M, Gap are all within 5mins walk! There is also a Victoria Secret beside the hotel. It is also a very centralised location for taking cab everywhere. We joined Dylan's tour and the pick-up point is just around the corner.

When we stated that we had not been pleased with the room on leaving, we were merely asked whether we had asked for a replacement on arrival, which we had not.

The rooms on the internet, which had lured us in, looked a lot better. We do not think that we got a fair deal. The breakfast arrangements in the restaurant were rather workmanlike. Food was brought and the waiting staff seemed to be constantly checking to see when they could clear away. We had some excellent breakfasts in our hotels in the States, but this was not one of them.

OK the rooms are not large but we were told that before we booked. They are kept beautifully clean and the beds are to die for.The best nights sleep that we had for the whole holiday. The location and proximity to Union Square is an added bonus as is the Cablecar stop right outside of the hotel. The hotel bar did close a bit early for our liking, but the complimentary bottle of wine in the room made up for it.However, we found a fantastic Bar just down the road on the right hand side which I can recommend. It is straight out of the 30`s , I think it is called the Golden Lounge. The little present for the ladies was a very nice touch, the chocolates had bloomed a bit but were very palatable. Breakfast was excellent in both quantity and quality as was the seemingly permanent availability of some of the best coffee I have tasted.

Hotel is on Union Square. Hotel is exactly what I was looking for. I like staying in five star hotels just like anyone would, and this hotel is not a five star hotel. But, if you are generally an easy going, non high strung person not irritated that something is not 'perfect' and brand new- this is a great hotel on Powell St. where the cable cars run and close to everything we wanted to do. Room is smallish but so what- all I did was sleep there. How much room beside the bed do you need? Bathroom has a shower, sink, and toilet. They all were clean and functioning. What else do you need? Breakfast was convenient and tasty. Bottom line: if you don't need a five star hotel in SF then you don't have to pay for one and can still have a great room at a great price (with add-on parking I would suggest).

I've stayed there before and if ever back in San Francisco will certainly stay there again. My only real gripe - and it's a general one rather than too specific to the Chancellor - is that when you are paying that amount for a room (any room), I always feel you should get breakfast included.

We were given adjoining rooms on the 12th floor overlooking Powell Street and the famous cable car line.

The fact that the rooms were adjoining ment we could circulate between them without having to go out in to the hallway though. The Hotel provided a rollaway bed for one of our sons which made their room a bit of a squeeze and we were told that they were phasing them out but it meant not having to pay for a third room for the 5 of us. We found the staff very pleasant and helpful and the reception area had nice settees with a large bowl of fruit and a breakfast bar beyond which we did not use. We had picked up a hire car from the airport and used the multistory car park in Sutter Street which the Hotel has an overnight arrangement with. Be careful though, the car park is a little difficult to find and we heard one couple complain that they had used the wrong park and had been charged the full overnight rate. The proximity to the Powell and Mason Line enabled us to see most of the city very easily using the day pass which I think was about $20.

There was a record on the computer that a member of staff had cancelled my booking.....so, whilst they could accommodate me for my 1st & second night, they had to find me an alternative for one night and re-book me for the next 7.....not much fun! The manager, Peter, was helpful but the staff member on the desk at my arrival was useless: not much of an apology just a casual announcement that I'd have to find somewhere else to stay on Friday night.

How wrong could we be! There were three problems, two of them major. The first was that the air conditioning was so noisy (and basic) that it woke us up every time it turned itself on (which was frequently). The second was that there was something in the room, which may have been mildew or some residue from cleaning products or the air conditioning system which caused a strong allergic reaction in my wife. The third was that when we complained the following morning, the hotel was totally unhelpful and devious and our attempts to speak to the management were frustrated at every turn. All we got was a message saying that there was no problem with our checking out and that we would get a refund for the nights we had not used followed by a later message saying that we would not get a refund but that we should arrange a charge back through the credit card company. When we tried to arrange this, the hotel responded by lying, saying among other things that we had not made the problem known to the front desk and that, had we done so they would have sorted everything out to our satisfaction, and then relying on the fact that we had made the reservation over the internet on a non-refundable basis and making it clear that they were going to keep our money.

Beware also non-refundable deposits in general.","date":"2014-04-09 03:00:58 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":1,"Location":4,"Overall":1,"Rooms":1,"Service":1,"Sleep Quality":1,"Value":1}},{"author":"Miss Dortha Howe","content":"The basic theme of the hotel is a farm and the rooms are supposed to be barn themed with cute curtains etc. The truth of the matter is that the rooms are basic, poorly furnished with basic wooden chairs and a very uncomfortable bed.

Many details made us feel at home, such as the Ipod dock in the rooms and the Ipads we could use free of charge during breakfast.

We always prefer smaller boutique places that are well designed and in actual neighborhoods vs. larger impersonal luxury hotels. TomTom didn't dissapoint! As previously mentioned, beautifully designed and furnished rooms, the best toiletries, etc. The roof deck is very nice with a great view. The location is amazing, in-between everywhere that you want to go but far enough away from the touristy madness. I'd argue it's one of the best situated hotels in Istanbul. As mentioned, it's a very steep but quick walk up to the main street of Isklal. However, this can be challenging if you have any mobility issues. In general, the area is rather hilly but so is most of Istanbul. In the other direction, you can walk up into a neighborhood renowned for antiques and nice cafes or down to the tram that takes you to the main tourist attractions or the road to get to Ortokoy or Bebek. At no point does it feel like you are in the \"tourist district\" but you never feel unwelcome or out of place. As for noise, we found the building itself to be quiet and well insulated. You didn't hear noise from the rooms around you and minimal noise from the room above. Nowhere near as bad as what an earlier reviewer described. The only real noise to speak of does come from the kids in the morning and the afternoon who walk on the dead-end road to and from school. Other than this, and some kids playing soccer on occasion, the street outside of the hotel is pretty quiet Breakfast in the morning is great. Freshly baked pastries (done at the hotel) and fruit, cheeses and meats, served by extremely friendly staff. Fuat in particular is a delight to interact with and was extremely helpful. The staff overall is very friendly and accommodating. Everyone at the front desk regardless of time of day did whatever they could to make sure we were receiving the best service possible. There are however a few things that need improvement to make the hotel even better. -While breakfast is excellent, we were less than impressed with dinner. To the point that we ate there once and did not choose to repeat the experience. The service was good but the quality of the food and the cooking was pretty bad esp. considering the prices of the food vs. what can be had in the neighborhood for much less. We are admitted foodies, but we didn't hold the hotel restaurant up to lofty expectations. This needs to be addressed. -While the staff is very friendly and eager to help, the hotel would benefit from a dedicated concierge or someone who really knows about the various restaurants around the city. With a hotel of this caliber, we expected them to be more informed about different places and to let us know how traffic can affect getting there, etc. If you didn't ask them these kinds of questions, it didn't occur to them to tell you. -Lastly, with the windows closed in the room there is zero airflow without having the heat on and it's extremely dry. I understand them not wanting to run the AC unless the temperature warrants, but there should be a way to circulate air without opening the windows in the spring (see my earlier comment about noise from school kids in the morning). In conclusion, we wouldn't hesitate to recommend TomTom to friends and hope to stay there again the next time we are in Istanbul.","date":"2015-07-17 19:17:23 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Peggie Little","content":"We had been at Istanbul for business purposes and used to stay at the well-known brands at Taxim.

I picked this hotel due to it's proximity to nightlife in the Latin Quarter and it looked nice. The bathroom had a walk in shower with glass door. Flatscreen TV had an aux speaker in the bathroom to hear the tv while doing your thing. Beds were very comfortable and the room we got was big and facing the street. The street was loud during mid afternoon due to the Catholic school playground down the block. We booked a room with two singles and when we went to check in we were told they had inadvertantly given our room away. I started to freak because I was sure we would get a fast one pulled as usually happens in western europe. We were happy that after my face of death look we were upgraded to a larger room with two double beds. Unfortunately for the poor lady who had booked the room they bumped her and I don't know where she was then moved. Overall the staff was slow on check'in. Breakfast was carbs and coffee. They have a person dedicated only to breakfast and coffee however it seems odd because this is a very small hotel. We were the youngest guests in the hotel by about 50 years.

My wife and I enjoyed our stay there immensely. This hotel is chic and luxuriously comfortable especially for the price. Admittedly, the room we had (Classic Double Room) was the smallest hotel room my wife and I had ever seen at about 3m x 3.5m (10' x 12'). The large outdoor terrace, fantastic bathroom (with HermÃ¨s products and great water pressure), deliciously comfortable bed, iPod docking station, super-fast free wi-fi and excellent service more than made up for the tiny room. Alex at the front desk was a delight as she answered our every question and was always happy to chat and share information. The location is excellent being only a few minutes walk from either the Rennes or St-Sulpice Metro stops, 100m from the beautiful Jardin du Luxembourg and within easy walking distance of the myriad of shops and restaurants on both the Rue de Rennes and Boulevard Saint-Germain. The hotel serves a decent continental breakfast which seems expensive at 18â‚¬ but we found a package that was below the normal rate and included breakfast. The breakfast room, as other reviewers have noted, is small and has only four tables for two. All of the tables were occupied each time we went for breakfast but the hotel happily served us as we sat in the little lounge area so it wasn't ever a problem. They don't serve lunch or dinner but there are two brasseries within 50m of the front door and many more restaurants and coffee shops just a few blocks away. There were a few other minor concerns that I had regarding this hotel: - The minibar is stocked only with two bottles of water. It would be nice if there was a limited selection of other beverages and also a kettle for tea\/coffee service. - The satellite television has almost 900 channels (yes, I went through them all late one night) but half of them are Arabic and almost all of the rest are in French save for one German language station, a couple of Italian stations and only Bloomberg for the English speakers. Although one doesn't go to Paris to watch TV in the room, it's nice to relax and watch the news or a movie after a long day on the town but unless the above suits you, you won't have much cause to even turn on the set. - The street is very small and it is very difficult to find parking. This is likely not a problem for most visitors but is something to keep in mind especially if you rent a car. Overall, my wife and I loved this hotel. The few cons are heavily outweighed by the comforts we enjoyed. We are very seasoned travelers and despite the tiny room, this hotel experience was one of our best ever. We will definitely stay at the Villa Madame again.","date":"2014-04-26 13:59:54 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":null,"vacancy":true}

The hotel says it's \"newly renovated\" and had free WIFI, so we figured it would be a nice place to spend a few hours and relax. HA! NOOOO! We laid on top of the beds, just to watch tv and instantly became itchy. Nothing about this hotel was \"newly renovated.\" The WIFI was extremely slow. The main picture of this hotel is deceiving. It looks a LOT worse and run-down in real life! Don't bother with this place.","date":"2014-12-12 12:32:09 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":1,"Overall":1,"Rooms":1,"Service":2,"Sleep Quality":1,"Value":1}},{"author":"Miss Alysha Goldner","content":"We didn't stay at the hotel so I can't comment on the rooms.

We had a flight early in the morning from Miami airport so we wanted a hotel close to the airport. I booked this through BOOKING.COM and payed Â£45. I have never stayed in Miami before so we did not know what areas were good and what was bad. When we checked in I wasa little concerned as there was a security hut and a guard at the door. We checked in and it was very run down and dirty. They asked for a credit card but I insisted on paying cash as there was no way I was going to hand over my card details. We parked our car and tried to find our room. The halls were all outdoors and very run down. There was a sign saying it had just had a refurb. I could not see where from the outside. It seemed that the area in Miami the motel was in was not a very good one, this concerned us a little. We finally found our room and went in. The room was very basic and smelt of damp. The dead lock on the door was broken and there was no safe in the room. We felt that uncomfortable that at night we pushed our suit cases up to the door. The shower had no presure and was only luke warm and the paint was peeling off from the bathroom. What really appauld us was the floor. I took my shoes and socks off and was walking around in bare foot. After two minutes my partner said \"LOOK AT YOUR FEET\". They were black. The floor was that dirty that in 2 mins my feet were black. I wet a towel and rubbed it along the floor. The towel changed to black and the carpet changed colour. The floor could do with a really good clean. The TV reception was very poor and fuzzy and we gave up in the end. Also the internet\/Wifi had little\/no signal. It was noisey outside and there were Police sirens sounding all night outside. We found it hard to sleep. We only stayed the night as we had to get up at 4 am to check in for our flight and we checked in at 8pm that evening. Otherwise we would have moved hotel. The only plus side was it was close to the airport. We did not stay for the breakfast but if itn was anything like the room we would have passed anyway. We did not use the pool as it was on the otherside of the motel right next to a main highway. It looked dirty and very uninviting. Please only stay at this motel if you have to or if it is free and you are feeling brave.","date":"2015-05-21 14:38:02 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":1,"Location":3,"Overall":1,"Rooms":2,"Service":1,"Sleep Quality":1,"Value":1}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.hotelmissoni.com\/hotelmissoni-edinburgh","vacancy":false}

I understand you need to talk to your friend on your cell, but could you get me the drink first? I also read that there would be cookies. Never saw any of them. When I checked out, I told the hotel clerk that my stay was terrible, he offered me a free night at the hotel. Why would I want to stay? There is a Hampton and a Marriott across the street. I don't know if they are any better, but I would consider them first next year when I visit Del Mar.","date":"2014-08-27 12:34:39 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":2,"Location":3,"Overall":1,"Rooms":3,"Service":1,"Value":1}},{"author":"Jeramie Goodwin","content":"Priceline (name your own price) $65 bucks.

We have been visiting SD for over 4 years and have stayed in many hotels from Oceanside to Sanysidro, from o the bigger chains to the little trendy ones down in the Gaslamp district, to the highrises by the harbor, and we have to say that The Dolphin was just perfect for our needs. We love traveling around the area and so most of the time we spend in a hotel is to sleep and take a shower, well we had just what we needed and it was clean, efficient and just right. The folks there are so nice and very helpful. We arrived in SD around 9 AM and our room was all ready for us to take a nap after traveling all night. That in itself was a very pleasant surprise. And that it is located right in the middle of all of the boat action, yacht clubs, we were delighted. We decided to use public transit, so the bus stop was right there, and it was easy to connect with the trolley as well. We have rented cars before while visiting, but because it was so easy to get around using transit, we loved staying there at the Dolphin. We weren't at all disturbed by noise from the street, but if you have a problem with that, just use ear plugs, but truthfully the white noise from the air unit took care of that. The rooms are small, but adequate and the shower is great, no shortage on anything. Wifi, anything that you may need, and breakfast outside in the courtyard. Everyone was so nice, not a grumpy one in the bunch. Where have you been all our lives , Dolphin, we will be staying there again probably next summer. Do not hesitate to stay at the Dolphin, of course if you would rather spend a lot of money go elsewhere. We love the Dolphin and hope all reads this as a total 100% recommendation.I do think that this is one for quieter people, they don't allow loud parties so be mindful of that.There are places in the area for partying, just call a cab to get home. Or do like us and walk. One highlight for us was the trip to Pt Loma lighthouse, just walk down the street and catch the bus, it is a beautiful place.

The main thing that changed my mind was not just that it is one of the most affordable motels in San Diego, but that it's proprietor takes the time to read all these reviews and actually responds to many of them. That is the mark of someone who truely cares about his business. My husband and I stayed at the Dolphin for 5 days towards the end of October. Although the weather was disappointing the Dolphin was not. The building itself is an older building but it is very well maintained. Yes, the rooms are small, but the bed is very comfortable and the room was very clean and everything in it worked great - especially the shower (great water pressure!). A continental style breakfast was provided every morning in the courtyard - coffee, juice, bananas, yogurt, muffins, McDonalds apple pies,etc. We never had a problem finding parking. The staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs. Even before we arrived for our stay, we were notified that the motel and surrounding area would be out of power the night we were to arrive. Jess provided us with a flashlight when we arrived. It is so rare to find people who actually enjoy thier job. Well, it was obvious that these folks do. I think the friendly and relaxed atmosphere that the staff creates, causes thier patrons to be more friendly as well. Whenever, we'd pass through the courtyard, other patrons would say hello or good morning. You're lucky if other people even look at you in public these days! My only advice to future patrons would be to be ready for thin walls. The folks next to us were not especially loud, but we could hear them talking pretty clearly through the walls. We turned the AC\/Heat unit in the room on \"fan\" and that helped alot. So, if you are a light sleeper bring earplugs or turn on that fan. Otherwise, the other patrons were very respectful of the \"9pm-9am quiet time.\" Thank you to the Dolphin for running such an affordable and pleasant establishment! We'll definitely stay here again if we ever travel to SD again. ~M.

We were greeted by a very helpful, congenial fellow, Jeb who throughout our 3 night visit made it more memorable than the motel itself. Actually the motel was memorable in its simplicity, making you realize just what you do and don't need in your 'home away from home\" when traveling. The rooms are just big enough for a very comfortable bed, a folding chair, a big flat screen TV on the wall, a couple of small bedside tables with lamps, a small closet (no light which was a tad annoying to me) and your basic tiny bathroom, shower no tub but great water pressure (always a plus for my husband). There is a room AC which is fairly noisy when on. If you just want outside air and leave your window open, there is both street, other vacationers and sometimes airport noise. WiFi is free but my husband had trouble at times connecting his iPad. The folks at the desk at one point generously gave him the use of their laptop! You won't find all kinds of specialty bath items in the bathroom, such as lotions, shoe shine stuff etc. BUT if you forgot your toothpaste or run out (as I did) or need a straight razor or other toiletries or even a hair dryer, they have them for you at the office. The room comes with breakfast which consists of good coffee, hot water for tea and tea bags, Yoplait yoghurt in the fridge and when we were there, daily muffins - big and for me overly sweet. Since my husband and I are trying to watch our carbohydrate intake, we tried to find other places close by for breakfast, the closest being the one on Rosecrans connected to the Holiday Inn, I think it was. I think it was called the Point Loma Cafe. We had breakfast there 2 of our three mornings. It was adequate, a sort of glorified Denny's, not cheap but you could find all kinds of egg dishes and the portions were huge. The last morning we decided to find another place for breakfast which I would recommend highly. The Living Room Coffeehouse, 1018 Rosecrans. I think you could walk there but we drove. I will write a special review of this place because I want to give it 5 stars for the delicious food at an incredibly reasonable price. All this said, we went by the Ramada Inn next door to compare prices - twice as much, no breakfast whatsoever and probably pretty much the same type of rooms although we didn't look. We've spent many a day in San Diego mostly in the downtown area so this area was new to us.

By contrast, the West Village area seemed quite busy when we were checking in. The two bedroom condo was comfortable and clean. The screened-in porch with screen door access outside was nice, though there was a pile of cigarette butts just outside the door, which should be cleaned-up in my opinion.

I'm not even sure when the lights go off - we were all so tired after spending every day in the parks we didn't really care. It also made the stay unique. I mean, how often do you see a lighted golf course? The course was not busy and my youngest son and I had some space to throw the football around. We did not use any of the pools while we were there, but did have some food and drinks in a couple of the pool areas. The pool areas seemed nice and the food and drinks were tasty. Check-in was easy, though once we checked in they did hit you up for the timeshare sales, which we declined and were never bothered again. The resort was clean and well maintained. There was no maid service for the week (although I believe you can request room cleaning for a fee), but it did have a washer and drier, which allowed us to pack far less for the week. The condo kitchen was very minimally stocked (nothing at all in the pantry or fridge so they probablty clean out anything that is left by prior vacationers). Fortunately, Target and Walmart are close (Target was right across from the resort) and there is a Publix (grocery store) that is right at the entrance to the resort, so there is no problem getting what you need to stock your condo. We did not take advantage of many of the resort's amenities and used the place as a convenient and cost effective place to stay off Disney property. It was perfect for that purpose. From what I could tell, I imagine that you could have a wonderful stay here if you wanted to use it as a \"destination resort\" with golf, swimming pools, food, activities, etc. It certainly appeared to have everything you would need for that purpose too.","date":"2014-04-28 13:16:57 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Waldo Treutel","content":"We had a great time here, had been made aware of the \"time share\" experience at the check-in, but arriving late at night and after a 18hr plus total trip time I guess the advisor knew that we were not in the mood for anything other than finding our unit.

I was a little skeptical about staying somewhere that was 40 miles from the ocean and also about all of the stuff I had read regarding the high pressure timeshare pitch, but had an overall great experience. Our room: POSITIVE: I booked our room through booking.com and received a significant price discount for paying in advance. We had a studio (2 queens, pullout couch and efficiency kitchen with table). It was a perfect set-up for our family. The beds were comfy, we had plenty of linens to get us thru the 4 days and the room was clean. We were centrally located and could easily access our car or the pool or the front desk from our room. Our room: NEGATIVE: Although I had requested that we be placed at River Island, our room was actually at the West Village - directly behind the check-in area. Thru booking.com, I was not made aware that the room type we requested was not available at River Island. Also, I had been lead to believe each room room a washer & dryer but in our building, they were actually down the hall - we were given enough laundry soap for 4 or 5 loads and we did not need coins to operate the machines. Time Share Experience: Upon check in, I firmly declined the $20 free gift to the woman who approached me. Additionally, we unplugged the phone in the hotel room and were not asked again to attend any timeshare presentations. My advice is to be polite but firm with your \"no\"...and trash the $20 certificate...FREE is a 4 letter word. Pool & Surroundings: The pool at the West Village was super nice. There were plenty of towels and chairs. At River Island, our friends got up early to break the rules and reserve chairs. There were signs that stated that reserving chairs was not permitted but there was nobody enforcing it. In fact, the only thing that was strictly enforced were the $9 per day lazy river blue tubes! Everyone had their own cooler packed with food & drink & cocktails and after 5 days the only person I saw get in trouble were people without armbands that were riding on tubes in the lazy river...they literally have a hook that they grab them from people with in 2 different stops around the river. We took advantage of the 2 for $4 domestic draft beers for happy hour and our friends took advantage of the $14.95 refillable soft drink container. Our kids liked the virgin daquiris with the $3 refills. Dining: We ate a Breezes one night and Pisan's pizza place. They were both average...the kids meals are all under $5.99 and I found the adult items to be reasonably priced. We went to Publix and got yummy Boars Head sandwiches a couple of times and we also kept breakfast & lunch stuff in our room. Other: None of us were a big fan of people smoking at the pool. It seemed like there were people smoking everywhere. Additionally, at the end of our hotel hall was an exit to outside and people stood outside that door and smoked so we had to walk thru it on our way to the pool. I even saw an employee standing there...we stayed at the Renaissance @ Sea World earlier in the week and they had a no-smoking policy in the pool area...that was super. My only other complaint was that the hotel rooms were super nice, but the hallway still had dingy ceiling tiles and the stairwells (by ashtray) and area by the stairwell entrances at West Village were dirty...they needed to be swept & painted. Overall a 4\/5 experience.","date":"2014-04-25 05:18:51 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":5}},{"author":"Margie Gerhold","content":"We just returned from a 2 night stay in a 2 br villa in the North Village of Orange Lake Resort.

We traveled with 2 kids, ages 11 and 2.The lagoon pool is good for toddlers because it has a kiddie pool, zero entry pool, and fountain area. That pool area also has a small slide, basketball goal in the pool, volleyball net, and arcade area for the older kids. The river pool has a lazy river, zero entry pool, 2 slides, and also was right next to the mini golf, huge inflattable slide, rock climbing, & bungie trampoline. We will return.

I wish I could say our trip went without a hitch but feel I must mention that the first villa they put us in wreaked of smoke (4022 West Village) however all it took was a call to the front desk and we were moved to unit 4285. They sent a van to help us since it was almost ten o'clock at night. We stayed 5 nights six days in a two bedroom villa in the West Village and loved every minute of it! Villa was very spacious for My husband and I plus my sister and our two year old. Two bedrooms and two full huge baths. Kitchen was outfitted nicely with washer and dryer large pantry, dishwasher and everything you need to cook all your meals there. It really was a home away from home. They provided dishwasher detergent (3 loads) clothes detergent 3 loads (so nice not to have to do a weeks worth of washes at home!) Also there was toilet paper and tissues as well as dishtowels stocked in each bathroom and kitchen. Beds were very comfortable as well as furnishings, must say again the furnishings in this unit were a little nicer in quality and age. Bathrooms and closets were more than adequate. Resort was spectacular the River Island area was gorgeous and lots to do for the whole family. Fees were not outrageous and I could see staying on resort the whole time however the Disney parks are no more than 20 minutes away. We did Hollywood studios (15 minutes) and Magic Kingdom (20 minutes with parking and all). We dined at the River Island Grilling Company and had a great meal great service and the food was reasonable. Also did the sunset celebration at the West Village Clubhouse restaurant more casual and also very good. No problems with any smell other than smoke in the first room, no issues with their sales pitch for the vacation club, I declined they still gave me my $20 resort coupon (which we didn't use), no issues with the cleanliness or comfort of the room. My only negative would be that there is only one way in and out which sometimes you have to wait for either at the gate and also you have to drive quite a bit to get to the other places of interest, pools bars restaurants in the resort but there was plenty of parking and we never had a issue.","date":"2015-11-19 08:51:40 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Lolita Schulist","content":"We opened the door to our 3 Bedroom\/3Bathroom Villa and said \"WOW\"...It's a luxury apartment, clean and we had everything we needed to enjoy our week stay with our family.

I made a mistake the first day in being too kind and that was a big mistake. I approached the check in desk and began the process of getting our keys. After the brief check in was finished, they directed me over to another counter where they showed me all these discounts I could get if I took a tour of the property. Whenever someone tells you they want 45 minutes of your time, RUN. The 45 minutes tour took over 3 hours - all with a 14 month old crying baby. I realize they are there to sell you a vacation rental but to put us through 4 or 5 people who hold you captive after saying NO over and over was really annoying. After that horrid experience was over, we had a wonderful vacation. We stayed in a 3 bedroom villa which was perfect for a family of 5. It was clean and very comfortable. It was safe to go for walks around the resort but we needed to hop in the car for a 4 minute drive to the main waterpark area because we had 3 small kids in tow. The pools were fun and not overly crowded even though we were there at March break. The poolside bars and restaurants were very reasonably priced and we relaxed in the warm sun while sipping on our drinks. We would definitely stay there again and will know to avoid any discount tickets offered. That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating.","date":"2012-05-14 08:35:17 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Chet Hermiston","content":"We stayed in #2476, a 2 BR, 2 BA villa in West Village. Although we are Holiday Inn Club members, our home base is at a different location. This was our first visit to Orange Lake, and we loved the well-maintained, spacious grounds and the privacy of a roomy villa. Our reservation was for 2 weeks, but I could have stayed longer. West Village is perfect for retirees wanting to escape cold, northern winters. The villas are ground level and parking for the car is just a few steps from the front door. The villa seemed to be older but appeared to be recently refurbished. Maintenance requests were handled promptly. The kitchen is well-equipped with a full-size range, refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, and washer\/dryer. There are cabinets for food storage above the laundry area. Paper products are provided, along with coffee for the first morning. Sliding glass doors led to the rear patio from both the living room and the master bedroom. The bathrooms are small, but all other rooms are large. A heated pool was a short walk away. The pool and hot tub enclosure held an ample supply of lounge chairs and tables with umbrellas. The pool towels are small but adequate. There are 2 more pools near the West Village Clubhouse about a 15-minute walk from the villa. If you want an even larger pool complex, you can take the shuttle to the beautiful River Island. North Village and East Village have pools, also. This resort is huge. We wasted the first few days at this wonderful resort trying to find fault with the place. Why? We attended a “member update” on the morning after our arrival. It was not a good experience. We chose not to accept their proposal and left the meeting with bitter feelings. I recommend that the sales presentation be scheduled for later in the visit, after you have an opportunity to enjoy some of what the resort has to offer.","date":"2012-12-26 07:49:58 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Mr. Anderson Rosenbaum","content":"We are owners at Orange Lake and have stayed here numerous times. We just returned last night from our vacation and are disappointed in our stay. At check-in we were given the opportunity to sign up for an owners update meeting, we understood that this was a sales pitch to try and convince us to switch our week into their points system. We were told it was an hour long meeting, but having sat through these before we understood that most likely it would go longer. The salesman who came over to help us was named Randall. He explained that he was not an employee of Orange Lake but instead contracted out to talk to individuals like us, who had a timeshare that was paid for in full but had not yet moved their week to points. He assured us that we would not have anyone else come over to talk to us because we were \"veterans\" of this process and therefore he would be taking care of everything. It is amazing how kind the sales team are as they are attempting to sell to you, and how quickly it changes once they realize you are not going to purchase anything. After his pitch, my husband and I said that we weren't interested in purchasing anything. Randall then had to take a call from his wife, and sent in someone else to offer us a new deal. It was such a scam! I told the next person that we were not interested in changing anything right now, once again this person became rude to us. I told him that one reason we will not put in anymore money to Orange Lake was because how rude they became during the presentation. Yesterday as we were packing up ready to go, my brother could not find his camera, we lifted the mattress up to look for it and saw this HUGE wad of dark black body hair lying on the box spring. I can't even begin to say how disgusting that was, to know that it had been there the whole week. My husband mentioned it to someone as he checked out and they said \"oh ok\", no one seemed to care. As current owners I am not sure if we will return to Orange Lake. I do know we won't be purchasing any upgrades to our current plan because of some of the experiences we have had at Orange Lake.","date":"2015-11-06 07:11:45 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":1,"Location":5,"Overall":3,"Rooms":1,"Service":1,"Sleep Quality":1,"Value":1}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.theestatehouse.info\/","vacancy":true}

We had a 2 bedroom unit in the west village, which was extremely clean and spacious. Two adults and 3 children (2 teens and a 'tween) comfortably shared the space, though one child chose to sleep on the sofa in the living room. The kitchen was very well-equipped with all the implements you could want for basic cooking, and had granite counters. The washer-dryer was useful and worked well. Bathrooms were spacious and clean, including the jacuzzi-style tub in the master bath. The complex seems to be in good repair. We were in Orlando for a soccer tournament, so we wanted space to relax between games, and got that. If I were there for a vacation, though, I would be disappointed with the amenities. Swimming pools seemed small, and even in December the miniature golf courses were crowded. Restaurants and the Marketplace mini-mart were expensive for what they offered. The River complex pool looked fun but too small for the vast size of the resort overall. Security at the gate was rather over-zealous, but it's easy to get in if you tell them you are checking in. The architecture is extremely monotonous, but not hideous. Friends who were also staying said the golf was pleasant but not memorable. As a place to stay, a larger-than-average hotel, it was fine. If I went there with the idea that it would provide entertainment for several days, I'd be disappointed. One nice touch was the array of starter goodies provided in the unit: dish soap, paper towels, laundry detergent, coffee. It was pricey but I'm sure a better deal could be had if you could be more flexible with your dates. Beware - they will try to get you into a sales session for the timeshare. And when you say no,they will call your unit to invite you yet again (to be fair, they offered $100 to come to the session). We were honest and said the only reason we were there was for a soccer tournament, and wouldn't want to vacation in Orlando otherwise, and they respected that and left us alone. Maybe those are the magic words? (Never a mention of a charge not to attend the sales pitch, btw.) Service was friendly and prompt - we were missing a couple small items from our unit and they delivered them promptly, and phone inquiries to various departments were answered quickly and accurately. The people working here are very friendly and helpful, and the housekeeping is excellent. The 7:05 AM shuttle to Disney cost about $20 each and was well worth the money.","date":"2013-04-24 09:02:56 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":3,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":3}},{"author":"Jessyca Wuckert MD","content":"We stayed at Orange Lake the week of December 4-11, 2011. I booked the rooms through world resorts international’s Buy with Me deal, and got 7 nights for a great price. After reading the reviews, I didn’t know what to expect when we checked in, however, we were pleasantly surprised! Recommend this place for families looking for vacation rental amenities and not hotel amenities. Check-in\/Check-Out No wait and courteous staff. The only criticism is the time-share tactics. The receptionist gave me the room key and $20 voucher. My family was waiting in the car, so I walked out to meet them. On my way out, the timeshare rep pounced! And when I told her that I had to meet my family, she said that I had to give her the $20 voucher back. It was the strangest thing. I knew that the voucher was a timeshare ploy, but if I knew they would demand it back if not used immediately, I would have declined to take it in the first place. But that was not a big deal because overall the staff was very courteous. After getting to our room, my husband called the front desk and asked if we could be moved off of ground level. They gave us several options and were very accommodating so overall I would rate the reception staff as excellent and the timeshare group as rough around the edges (we had to unplug our phones because they literally called us non-stop even after we picked up and said we weren’t interested.). Property We stayed on the 5th floor of the East Village. It looked like this was a recently renovated\/built section because the rooms were clean with modern décor. The receptionist said that all rooms in the East Village are similar. The entire property is huge! It took about 5 minutes to drive from the reception to the East Village because of the winding roads, golf carts, pedestrians, etc. Driving through, it looks like the West Village and possibly North Village as well, are the older, one level rooms. They actually look like little houses. I’m not sure how they look on the inside, but I don’t think I would want to stay there. I like the more modern look and feel of the East village. I loved that there was a pool in the East Village and a restaurant as well. There are like 8-10 places to eat on the resort and at least 4-5 deliver until 10pm. We ate at The Legends once and the food was OK. We did not really use the amenities on the resort. We went to the pool once in the East Village. It was very quiet and cold during our stay. There is a lazy river in River Island, but we never checked it out. The property has a great location, with a Publix, Walgreens, Target right next door. Very convenient! Also, this place so close to Disney. We went to Magic Kingdom and after the hustle and bustle of getting into and out of the park, it was nice that our ride home was less than 10-15 minutes. Room We had a 2 bedroom condo. It was clean, spacious and very comfortable. The kitchen was equipped with cooking essentials, although a few pots and pans needed replacing and one burner was broken. The TVs are dated, but the living room has a DVD player which was nice. The bedroom TVs had bad reception. They have extra sheets and blankets for the sofa bed. We found one blanket had food stains on it, but thankfully the place was equipped with a washer\/dryer and detergent. Overall the imperfections did not stress me because of the deal I received, but it would bother me more if I would have paid full price. I would stay here again, and would recommend this place to family and friends.","date":"2012-08-29 14:58:17 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Frederique Williamson Jr.","content":"I recently went on a trip with my partner to orlando and got a great deal Via Bootit.com on this hotel.

I was fortunate that I lived in Miami for three years and knew the roadways very well. The fact that this property does not include any continental breakfast shocked me. There is a deli and coffee shop inside with plenty of seating. But the prices for food and drinks were a little high for my liking. One would think that since the property was far off the beaten path the management would offer some form of discount or reduce costs for patrons. As far as other issues with this property, the jacuzzi was not hot at all. It was mostly luke warm at best. The elevator was broken 2 of the 4 days I stayed. The maintenance of the building is lacking. The bright spot of the stay was the people at the front desk. They were very responsive to all issues but was unable to get them fixed. I guess the maintenance department needs new help. I probably will not stay at this property again or recommended it to anyone.","date":"2013-09-27 00:04:59 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":1,"Overall":3,"Rooms":3,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Alene Kunze","content":"You get what you pay for: - Poor lit, smelly corridors. - Stained walls and carpets. - Noisy rooms. - Slow internet connection in room, not wireless (43.37 kbps - measured) - Rude customer service at front desk. - No security. - Unreliable airport shuttle.

We had a 2-bedroom unit on the 7th floor and were extremely happy with all the extra space. Lots of closets, plenty of towels, a large kitchen with major appliances, an in-room safe--all the extras were there. The beds and furniture seem newish. The master bath has a tub and a separate shower, two sinks, and two huge closets. The location is at the far southern end of International Drive, next door to the Premium Outlets Mall. There is a Publix grocery store within strolling distance (although it might be a bit much to stroll back with groceries) so it's easy to stock up on food and beverages instead of spending a fortune at area restaurants. The guests are a mix of US, Canadian, German and Brazilian citizens and it seems to appeal to families attending sports tournaments at Disney's Wide World of Sports complex. The desk staff was congenial --although if this was my hotel, I'd ask them to dress with a bit more professional polish. And that's the only thing lacking at Lake Eve. It's got top-notch condos, great amenities and a perfect location to enjoy the Disney parks--it only needs to step up its image and service to make it one of the more desireable stays in the Orlando area.","date":"2012-01-08 04:49:52 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Elbert Pouros IV","content":"We are a family of six-- my husband & I with 3 teenage girls & a 10 year old son. We always look for a hotel suite or multiple rooms when we vacation. Lake Eve was perfect! We searched through Booking.com for a good deal & this was the best we found. A 3 bedroom suite for $149! I questioned whether it was in a good area & whether it was a nice place. We looked at the reviews & the worst reviews were that it didn't have free wi-fi in the rooms so we did a little research on the hotel website and found out that's not even true. When we arrived there was free valet parking, which was a plus. When we got to our room, we were VERY happy. The kitchen was very spacious. The dining table was large enough for all of us. The living area was ample. The balcony was huge! We had a view of the beautiful pool & lake. The bedrooms were a good size and warm & cozy. Bathrooms were pretty & clean. Everything seemed new & updated, We did have free wi-fi in our room. We ALL got a good night sleep, also, as the beds were very comfortable. We have nothing negative to say about our room. We were in Orlando to go to Universal. I almost didn't book Lake Eve because I wanted something close to Universal. But since we were so close to I-4 it didn't take long to get there and it was very EASY to get there. We loved that Lake Eve was situated on a quiet area of International Drive and yet so close to I-4. The only downer to our stay was in the morning when we all wanted breakfast. There was a breakfast buffet for $8 or you could order a la carte items. The buffet reminded us of nicer continental breakfast bars we've had at other hotels for free-- not worth $8. Some of the a la carte items on the menu looked good & reasonably priced but we opted to go out to breakfast where there was more variety. We went to the Denny's down the street. We ARE NOT Denny's fans-- we never go at home. But we were starving! This Denny's was actually not bad--we were pleasantly surprised! We are very happy that we ended up at Lake Eve. It was perfect for our family. We'd definitely go back!","date":"2012-11-01 17:34:08 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.gardenstown.com","vacancy":false}

The reception staff were extremely helpful and accommodating - couldn't have asked for anything more. We did experience a problem whilst we were there however someone was sent to our room with 90 minutes (and that was at 22:00). The view from our 13th floor room was fantastic, overlooking the pool and Lake Eve. The pool area can start to get shaded by 14:00-15:00 hours in the afternoon, but this didn't seem to bother most people. Location wise, there is a Walgreens and Publix just down the road (you could actually walk there). In the other direction there is a petrol station and Pik N Run mini-supermarket which also sold hot\/cold food. We absolutely loved it here and the location is fantastic the only thing that I could comment negatively about is the housekeeping. It was tidied around everyday but I don't think that the floors were mopped or vacuumed the whole time we were there. When you got out of the shower, your feet would be dirty again within 10 minutes!

If you're looking for a great deal - inexpensive, nice, clean resort that's within driving distance of the major attractions, Lake Eve is great. We were a bit hesitant to stay here with the negative reviews, but felt that the issues were ones we could deal with for the price we'd be paying. The front desk staff were kind & everything went as planned. In terms of the other issues mentioned here: Valet - you do not need to use the valet services & can park anywhere else in the lot easily. On the weekend nights, it did get a little more crowded, but the lot itself is small, so it's not a far distance. Pool - the pool is nice, but you will not get any sun as it sits behind the hotel, on the lake. Ads\/Menus - Yes, during the afternoon, menus are slipped under the door from local pizzerias. We live in NY, so this was not something we were concerned about. Cleaning - The cleaning staff made the beds & cleaned up the towels. Any clean items in the dishwasher were taken out for you to use. The cleaning staff came once a day - if you were not ready at that time, they weren't able to come back later. Food - save yourself the hassle of trying to determine when\/if the restaurant is open. You can easily go down the street to one of about 5 Publix grocery stores & pick up anything you need. This hotel had families, couples, and business travelers, but never felt crowded or too busy. The rooms are huge & new. They have all the amenities of home, which helps you save money when you're visiting the area. Having a full kitchen + washer & dryer is amazingly helpful. Although the hotel is on I-Drive, it is further away from the hectic parts & has very little traffic.

This place was a perfect location and it definitely beat staying downtown at the Hilton with the rest of the attendees. We were right on the edge of the French Quarter withing walking distance of the whole area. The location on Esplanade is more of a residential area so you are near the fun but far enough away to enjoy some quiet downtime. We loved the trolly car right across the street and we took that down to the conference center for the conference days we attended. We also took it up Canal Street and nearly delivered to the WWII museum. From there we were able to catch a ride to the Garden District - a must see if you love old architecture - beautiful old homes(mansions). We at lunch ate Joey K's there and it was excellent. We ate so many places in the French Quarter I can't remember all the names. My husband loved all the NOL foods - gumbo, jambalya and more. I'm glad we found the Louisiana Pizza Kitchen right on the other side of the U.S. Mint (across the street from Monnaie). Small little spot but excellent pizza! The day we arrived was a huge jazz festival going on across the street. However, once in our rooms, you couldn't hear any outside noise. Just the train at night blowin it's whistle! We enjoyed being so close to the French Market and within walking distance of all the sites to see. And you can't pass up the Cafe du Monde down the street - a busy happenning place with the best French dougnuts!!!Delicious! We will defintely come back and would stay here again. We were not hounded to purchase anything. My husband only received one phone call regarding timeshare and the woman was very pleasant. The staff was laid back and friendly.

My stay here was fantastic. Lydia, the manager (owner? not sure) is as sweet and helpful as she can be, and hotel staff are kind and always ready to help with anything. The location on St. Charles means a $6 cab ride to the French Quarter in one direction and Uptown in the other. This means you're not far from the party, but when you've had enough you're a cheap cab ride to your quiet hotel room. Also, the location means hailing a cab at most hours of the day\/night is super easy. The room was spotless, the bed was comfortable, the patio was precious. Stay here! You won't regret it.

We were very impressed with the hotel. With paying such a cheap rate ($59\/night), I was a little nervous about what we'd get because 'you get what you pay for'. We arrived in town around 11 a.m. and didn't figure our room would be ready, but figured we'd stop and see anyway. Well, it wasn't so we decided to take the street car down to the French Quarter and start our sight seeing. We left our luggage in the car because we drove down, but they were also willing to store your luggage in a side room for you if you needed to. We had left our phone number with them, so they called us when the room was ready, which was nice so we didn't have to keep wondering. We chose to park on the side streets, not in the garage that was offered, and had absolutely no problems. The hardest time we had finding parking was in the French Quarter, not around our hotel. After checking in, showing us our room and offering to help carry our luggage for us, the girl working the front desk left us to get settled in. Our room was great!! It was number 47 which I would definitely recommend. It was on the top floor on the front so we had two double doors going out to the balcony and a king size bed. They made this room very modern, as well. The bed (king size) was not the most comfortable, but it served its purpose. My only two complaints about this hotel would be the light in the bathroom above the mirror didn't work and the light bulb in the ceiling didn't work all the time as well. My husband was trying to get the bulb in the ceiling to work, and it shattered everywhere. They came up and cleaned it up very quickly, but never got it replaced, so I had to do my hair\/makeup in the main room with the light from a lamp. My second complaint is there's no phone in the room. That made our previous problem a little inconvenient. Overall, I would recommend this hotel! It's location was great with the street car right out front and two great restaurants on each side of it! We never walked to the French Quarter, but it was definitely do-able. Kudos to the Avenue Garden Hotel!!!","date":"2012-06-16 09:09:12 +0300","ratings":{"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Blanche Berge","content":"This is one of the nicest hotels that i have stayed in.

The hotel certainly not a \"4-star hotel\" by the standard definition, but it deserves 4 stars based on the price-to-quality ratio. My wife and I, who are both \"poor\" students, stayed there 3 nights, right before Christmas, and paid $53\/night. The hotel was acceptable; the hotel itself was definitely a good value for the price and location, especially considering most other hotels in the ZIP code were nearly twice as expensive. It's not in the heart of the French Quarter, but that section is loud and crowded anyway, so I liked being a mile away from the \"action.\" The St. Charles trolley stops 20 ft. from the hotel door and will take you right to Burbon Street\/French Quarter within 10 minutes, so, if you want to save $30-$50 by not staying in the F.Q., this hotel is a good bet. The best deal for transportation is to buy a 3-day trolley\/bus pass, which is available for $12 at Williams Grocery about 8 blocks up St. Charles. (It's easy to miss the sign, unless you're walking on the opposite side of the street.) If you fly in, don't rent a car unless you must. Parking is scarce and expensive, and the streets are narrow and confusing. We took the E-2 bus, which runs from the airport's upper deck right into the heart of the N.O. business district (downtown). It is about a 10-15 block walk to the hotel from the final stop of the bus to the hotel. It's around a 15 minute walk, quite an exercise when you're towing luggage, but it is not too bad compared to the $26-$28 that you would spend on a cab or a shuttle for two. The hotel is fairly clean, though older. It is like a mediocre bed and breakfast. There were places that could have used a touch of paint, and there was a little rust on the metal fixtures. You must be rung into the building by someone at the front desk, and there is no one manning the desk in the middle of the night (11 pm to 7 am, I believe), so they give you a key to get into the hotel along with your room key. All in all, though, it was not that bad. Unless you're used to staying in the Ritz-Carlton, this is a fine choice for those on a budget. Besides, when you're a tourist to N.O., you don't really spend much time in the hotel anyway. Each morning, there is a continental breakfast. It's decent--bagles, English muffins, cereal with milk, orange juice; one morning there was also cinnamon bread and hard-boiled eggs. There is almost always free Twinnings tea and mediocre coffee (though sometimes they ran out of tea bags; you can ask for more, though). Next to the small eating area (gets crowded in the morning), there is a small outdoor patio where you can eat if the weather permits. There is also a sitting room\/computer room. Internet use is free, but there is sometimes a line of 2-3 people waiting to use the one computer during popular hours. The decoration of this room is a bit tacky and outdated (ugly green cover on the couch, old unread books on bookshelves, antiquated computer manuals with the books, etc.). The room was acceptable, TV had dozens of cable channels, bathroom was fairly clean, and maid was competent. There was no \"Do Not Disturb\" doorhanger, so I guess you have no choice about maid service. The bed was large and comfortable, and the room, as promised, included ironing board, table, chairs, and extra pillow. There was an ice bucket, but it did not come with a liner bag, and I never saw an ice machine anyway, so we didn't use the bucket. The staff seemed nice, but I didn't get the extreme friendliness that other people have reported. We arrived a few hours early, and William let us check in early after a 15-min wait to get the room ready, so that was nice. He wasn't especially friendly, but was not rude either; he was just \"there.\" The other staff members were just \"there\" for us too. I have no specific complaints or praises for them. The one main complaint I have happened one week after we checked out. We prepaid for the room, so we did not have to pay when we checked in or out. However, since we had paid in advance, when we checked in, we were charged a provisional $60 to offset any expenses we might incur while there. This was fine with me; many hotels do this, and I knew we would have no other expenses of importance on the room. We were supposed to have this provisional charge refunded when we left if there were no other charges. While we were there, the only additional expenses we had were 2 local phone calls (35 cents each)--that's it. Well, a week after we checked out, I viewed my credit card statment and found that we had been charged $43 extra!! (not 70 cents!) I immediately called the hotel and asked for the reason for this charge. The woman who answered appeared to be new. She looked at my account in the computer and could not find any record of this extra charge. She said (this is a direct quote), \"We didn't make no charges on your card.\" I told her I was looking right at my credit card statement with the extra $43 charge, so someone obviously did. She could not explain it, so I asked that William to call me the next day, since he was the one who checked me in. I thought maybe he could explain the extra charge. I didn't receive a phone call, but I did contact my credit card company to challenge the bogus charge, and they took it off. I'm still not sure why this charge was made, so I recommend anyone staying at this hotel to double-check your credit card statement to make sure your card is properly charged. If it hadn't been for this frustrating surprise, I would have granted the hotel a 4 rating. I would probably stay here again if I return to N.O., but I'll be sure to watch the charges to my card.","date":"2013-07-21 04:10:10 +0300","ratings":{"Overall":3}},{"author":"Madge Stanton","content":"Myself and a few buddies arrived in New Orleans after a long drive to escape the hurricanes in Florida.

I think we made the perfect choice. PROS: 1. Location is fantastic. If you head out the back entrance you are a block from Bourbon street, yet when you return home you feel a world away, which is fantastic when you see how seedy some elements along Bourbon street are (FYI I felt safe the entire trip and walked around on my own). 2. Rooms, I thought they were great. Our bed was comfy, our room was well decorated. The bathroom, though not huge, was tasteful, and separate door for comode from the rest of the bathroom, which I liked. 3. Service, the conceirge was helpful, when I asked for guidance on two occasions I got knowledgeable, professional advice, without the condescending air some concierges have. Bellhop was friendly and helpful. I like turn down service, bring me little chocolates and bedside slippers and I'm a happy camper. Check in & check out were a breeze. 4. Crowd, pretty upscale people (I know, snobby, but New Orleans is a mixed bag my friends--part of the charm but nice to have a break from the \"charming\"). I saw a few NBA players from Houston in the lobby...funny how they stand out. 5. Cost, we found the rates for our dates more than affordable, given the caliber of the hotel 6. Gym, it's pretty darn nice for a hotel, they have the cardio room with individual TVs on the machines, a weight room, and a Yoga stretch room with weights, medicine balls and cool yoga mats. I spent like an hour doing yoga by myself, uninterrupted. fun. CONS: 1. Noise, our room faced Canal street and I didn't hear regular traffic but the first night I heard several sets of sirens from emergency vehicles. My husband never woke, and I didn't hear it subsequent nights. Perhaps a courtyard room would be quiter. 2. Pool, only indoor lap pool and jacuzzi. For such a hot climate, a nice pool scene could be fun. Tips 1. We traveled in January. I'm from San Diego and packed for San Diego winter. It was 75 degrees and 97% humidity. I made use of the Shops at Canal (Athropologie, Saks 5th Avenue, Banana Republic, Ann Taylor...I missed you JCREW coming FEb 2012). I wish I had brought one warm weather outfit \"Just in case\"...learn from my mistake. 2. Men bring sports coats, for restaurants like Galatoire's and Commander's Palace, where you'll stick out without one. (By the way, we enjoyed Galatoire's, Commander's Palace was disappointing to us). 3. St Charles Streetcar $1.25 one way, or $3 all day pass, need exact change, the pick up stop at Lady Footlocker on Canal about a block away. I had a Garden District walking tour in the travel book from the library and it gave history on homes in the area (ie Ann Rice's former home, Jefferson Davis' home, etc). Great city to visit.

Now for the drawbacks...the bed certainly wasn't the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, but it didn't negatively affect my sleeping habits. The room I stayed in also faced the street, so any street noise could be heard, but it wasn't any louder than average. The hallway was also slightly dingy, and one minor complaint was that the blinds didn't reach all the way to the bottom of the window sill, as the room had windows that were quite tall. Other than that, I would definitely stay at Copley House again and recommend it to anyone needing a place to stay in Boston. The location is very hard to beat, especially for the price, as it is a few short blocks to all the shopping and the T at Prudential Center. And for a New Yorker like me who is used to walking, it's a short walk to Newbury Street and many other sites in the city.","date":"2012-09-20 12:56:06 +0300","ratings":{"Check in \/ front desk":3,"Cleanliness":3,"Location":4,"Overall":3,"Rooms":3,"Service":3,"Value":4}},{"author":"Ms. Rudy Breitenberg","content":"I made an on-line reservation for $70 per night plus tax.

I had no idea what time she was coming but I knew I had to get a room in Boston for her fast due to the weather. Well by 8 pm that night, I found out she was not coming to Boston. I panicked because I had used my personal credit card to make this reservation and I was four hours past the cutoff to cancel. I called reservations at the hotel and the man I spoke with couldn't have been nicer. He told me that there was no problem and that all fees due to my late cancellation would be waived because of Hurricane Irene. I apologized profusely but he insisted it was no problem. He then thanked me for being patient while he did all that was necessary to get me free of this charge. At the end, he even told me to stay safe in NYC.

Do yourself and your family a favor and do NOT go to this hotel no matter what cheap rate they offer.","date":"2012-01-02 21:29:27 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":1,"Location":2,"Overall":1,"Rooms":1,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":1,"Value":3}},{"author":"Tavares Denesik","content":"This was my second time to stay at this hotel.

They are billed as a \"Botique Hotel\" and certainly fit the bill as much as a chain can be considered a \"Botique\". The place is very bare bones and minimal, yet very stylish and modern. They just give you the very basics of what you need and not much else, but the price reflects that. So it's hard to complain. There are 10 floors and approximately 4 small rooms\/floor. It's not the kind of place I'd spend a whole week because it's rather small, has limited storage, and very few of the \"extras\" you'd need for an extended stay. But for staying a night or two in NYC when you just need a place to sleep and shower it does just fine. I forgot to take photos this time, but as of today the photos the hotel has provided on various travel websites are fairly accurate. You just have to take a close look at them to see how small the space really is and understand that the photos really show the WHOLE room. There's not much cropped out! BATHROOM: Clean, basic, and modern. It was pretty much a standard hotel sized bathroom, even though the main room was small. BEDS: Two double beds. Very comfortable, leaning towards the soft side of hotel beds. Sheets were clean and more modern\/stylish than you'd find in most chain hotels. BILLING: Reserved via choicehotels.com only a few days ahead of time. The front desk had no problems getting us checked in, and the taxes\/surcharges only added up to another 16% of the cost of the room itself. BREAKFAST: There is free coffee\/tea in the room, but i never looked for a continental breakfast. There were vending machines in the basement with the ice\/water machine. CLEANING: The room was as clean as it gets. While the building is obviously old, it seems that the entire interior is brand new. CLIMATE CONTROL: There was a brand new heater\/air conditioning unit that was very quiet and easily adjustable. ELEVATORS: One main, new looking elevator in the lobby. It worked just fine and was fairly large. FRONT DESK: The front desk was helpful and competent. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a room to be cleaned. They may have had the smallest, most basic lobby i've ever seen in my life. But if you're looking for water fountains and gold trim you're not going to get it in a hotel with sub-$200 rates! GYM: None. HOT TUB: None. INTERNET: Didn't try it. I was too busy enjoying the city. LOCATION: On the west-side on 36th very close to the corner of 10th. It's a much more sparsely populated and quiet area than most of Manhattan, as it borders on more of an industrial zone. However, it's only a few blocks to Times Square, Penn Station, and Madison Square Garden. It's a block from the entrace to the Lincoln Tunnel. It was nice to be so close to everything, yet just off the \"beaten path\" in a calmer area. There's a gas station on the corner (one of the few in Manhattan) and a few other random bodegas and restaurants nearby. NOISE: It's NYC, there's always going to be some noise, but there was nothing excessive. Lots of trucks roll down 10th avenue at night, but they mostly just blended into the background. PARKING: None. It's best to find a park & ride outside the city and take a train in. Penn Station is just 2 short blocks and then 2 long blocks away. POOL: None. RECREATION: None. RESTAURANT: None, but it's New York. I'm sure you can find something to eat. For the less adventurous, I did notice a McDonald's on 10th, just a short walk from the hotel. ROOM: The room was small and there wasn't much room around the beds. I'll admit, for 3 people, it was a bit cramped. If you like your space I'd limit occupancy to 2 or find another, bigger, hotel. There was limited storage, just one small wardrobe with 2 drawers underneath, a small nightstand, alarm clock\/ipod player, desk, desk chair, and flat screen TV. Again, the decor was very modern. SHUTTLE: None. STORE: None on site, a gas station on the corner, several bodegas nearby. SUPPLIES: Standard Soap, Shampoo, Conditioner, Mouthwash & Towels. ===== ===== ===== RATING NOTE: My ratings are generally based on value vs money. Thus, sometimes a simple hotel will receive a 4 or 5, while a fancy hotel can rank a 1 or 2 if I don't feel it was worth the cost. Also, a hotel can do everything right and still only rank as a 4, unless there's something really exceptional about it. 5 = Hotel gets everything right, and goes above and beyond. 4 = Hotel gets everything right. 3 = Hotel is acceptable value for money spent. 2 = Hotel isn't worth the money spent. 1 = Hotel should pay ME to stay there.","date":"2014-09-30 09:41:30 +0300","ratings":{"Check in \/ front desk":3,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":3,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.tantallonhouse.co.uk\/","vacancy":false}

The only thing keeping me from giving this hotel 5 stars is that housekeeping left a bit to be desired. It was noticeable that they hadn't cleaned behind the bathroom door in some time - lots of fingerprints etc. Maybe that's just my own pickiness. Also on the last 24 hours of stay we were literally rationing toilet paper (not replenished by housekeeping) and did without wash cloths - they left us 1 for a room that accomodates 4 guests.

Sure you cant walk to places to eat or shop from the hotel but you knew this when you mad a reservation here, its not the hotels fault you cant use a map! Ok, with that being said I booked this hotel for a last minute stay int he area, I normally like to stay more towards the center of Dallas but with a rate of $92 all in I figured I couldnt go wrong. An additional incentive to me was their comp. self parking in a garage, I dont mind paying to park but I dont trust most valets with some of my diff. cars. When I arrived at the hotel I noticed while about 15 minutes to downtown it was right off the expressway so it was no problem to get anywhere in the city in a decent amount of time. The bell staff were quick to collect my bags and take me to my room. The rooms werent very large but were decorated very nicely as the rest of the hotel was and were more then adequate for 1 or 2 people. I did not notice any elevator noise as some complained of. The only downside I noticed on the hard product the outside of the hotel could use a good pressure cleaning or fresh paint. Service was where the Omni really impressed me. Ive stayed at lots of 5-Diamond hotels that would have trouble keeping up with the Omni's service standard. I was always greeted very quickly and by name. Everything was done quickly when I requested it and I never once heard a no. I had one unusual request that they had no need to fulfill but they did it for me anyways, I was very impressed! I normally do not eat at the hotels as I like to go to local, well known establishments when Im in different cities. However, one night I was extremely tired and not very hungry. I ordered a childrens cheese burger with french fries (probably the same size as the adult burger!), ice cream for dessert and a bottle of Pellegrino water, for around $12. The quality was very good as well. I would not hesitate to stay here again, very good job to everyone at the Omni!","date":"2015-03-02 22:19:30 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":3,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Jessica Corwin","content":"I book two to three dozen conferences a year around the country and the staff at the Omni West were the very best to deliver exactly what I asked for but more.

A no-frills hotel, provides free high speed internet (which worked quite well) and meals are very economical with a good amount of options. Their respect for global cultures was reflected in their prompt agreement and arrangement for vegetarian food options (although repetitive each day).

Which is excellent. Next door to convention center, around the corner from Pacific Plaza mall. 10 short blocks to Pikes Place, 5 to Capitol Hill. The room I ended up with was extremely small, I was alone so it worked out, if there would have been two of us it would have been challenging. The room was on the 8th floor facing the court yard which made for no noise but was interesting to see the other high rise residentials surrounding the courtyard, we could all look into each others windows, kind of disturbing and at the same time intriquing, I had to remind myself not to be rude and watch people eat or watch TV.The hotel is undergoing a name change and will be undergoing severe renovations which are much needed since it is in an upscale area, of course hwne they get done it will probably double the price of about $100 which I paid. scedule is to be done by summer of 2007.I would definately stay here again but probably spring for the suite rather than the standard room. Also parking is $21\/day, kind of steep, but the internet was free, and even if it wasnt there were enough unsecure WIFI networks in the area to not worry about it if they did charge.A decent experience overall, now that I know what to expect.","date":"2013-05-08 17:54:41 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":4,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":3,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":2,"Service":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Marcelino Nolan","content":"Nice hotel and good location I stayed at the Summerfield Suites for 2 nights over the Easter long weekend, April 14-16. We made this reservation on hotwire. Check-in was quick. There was a business competition next door at the convention center so there were many high schoolers at the hotel walking around. We were given a room on the 8th floor, close to the elevator. When we opened the door, there was someone in the room so we walked back to the reception desk and asked for another room. The check-in clerk saw that he made a mistake so he gave us a suite on the 8th floor. The suite was big with a full kitchen, living room, a separate bedroom and full bathroom. A very good trade for the small inconvenience.Everything in the suite was clean, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spotless. They now have toiletries with Hyatt on it. There is a workout room with hot tub and outdoor swimming pool on the 5th floor. They don't have a business center although they offer wireless internet in the rooms (so take your laptop). Every morning, they serve complimentary continental breakfast (includes bread, bagel, waffle, fresh fruit, cereal, juice, coffee). This was our first time to Seattle so we wanted to see everything. The location of the hotel is great. You can practically walk everywhere although you will be tired. Pike place market is 8 blocks down towards the water. The hotel offers a free shuttle in the downtown area which we used to drop us off at Pioneer square. We also found out that the buses in the downtown area are free and the last stop is 1 block from Summerfield Suites, right in front of the convention center. Parking - the hotel charges $20 for parking each night. We had a car but did not want to pay the fee so we parked on the street at night (free after 6pm and on Sundays). During the day, there is a parking lot on Pike, between 5th and 6th that offers $5 all day parking on the weekends. We paid a total of $5 for parking during our stay.On the second night, there were people who stayed a few doors down from our suite with dogs. You can hear them barking loudly until 11pm. After that, it stopped. If you have allergies to pets, you may want to confirm with the hotel that you get a room that have not have pets there before.All in all, we had a great stay at Summerfield suites and would stay here again the next time we are in Seattle.","date":"2013-02-27 11:55:40 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":-1,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":4,"Value":5}},{"author":"Zackary Cole","content":"Great Location I had to cut short a previous trip to Seattle and the manager allowed me to transfer my pre-paid days to Labor Day weekend, which I thought was generous since they had done nothing to warrant my not honoring my earlier stay.

The shuttle service is very convienent, and dropped me off and picked me up from a football game at the stadium. My only real complaint is that the fitness room is not for anyone who wants to any more than ride on a stationary bike or take a dip in the pool.

The hotel staff is friendly. I know using priceline.com sometimes your flight times will not correspond with hotel check in times but we were able to drop off luggage and continue with the day. I called the hotel later that day (before the 3 PM check in time) and requested a room on a higher floor if possible and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would try to get a room on a higher floor if available (we were able to see the top of the 1 World Trade tower from our room) because there are buildings on every side and it looked like views on the lower floors might be limited. As far as amenities it was everything we needed. Coffee maker and free coffee, iron and ironing board, TV (basic cable and I think HBO), very comfortable bed, Heat\/A\/C unit below the window with a thermostat on the wall which is not annoying or creaky but makes a nice sound at night which helped me sleep and drowns out any outside noise, there is a vending and ice machine on the 2nd floor and a restaurant on the 1st floor (I didn't eat there so I won't comment on it but I know it was open early in the morning but closed when we returned around 11 PM). There are a couple of computers that you can stand up and use right by the elevators but I wouldn't expect to surf the web or anything. I guess they might come in handy if you forgot to print some tickets, itinerary or needed to check your email real quick. The area is very quiet at night and on the weekends which was fine with me (no outside noise, slept great) because you are a 2 minute walk from the Fulton Street subway station that gets you anywhere in the city at anytime of the day or night. There is also a 24 hr CVS right up the street if you need to pick up anything that you might have forgotten or might be prohibited to take on a plane. I enjoyed the area overall though. You are a very quick walk from Wall Street, Trinity Church, Federal Hall, World Trade Center Site ect. The only thing I would suggest is that if you are in Midtown you probably should eat or get food to bring back up there because after 9-10 PM a lot of the restaurants in close walking distance to the hotel are closed. There are a few places open but your selection is very limited. The bottom line is that it is a Holiday Inn, not the Plaza, so you shouldn't expect a ton of amenities but the area is safe, the rooms are clean and you will sleep good.","date":"2012-04-02 03:51:40 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":4,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Hillary Cormier","content":"We stayed in a double room, which was incredibly cramped, but for Manhattan I dont think you could ask for much more - we got a good rate and booking was easy - booked on labour day weekend for the sunday night (booked on Saturday) and was pretty effortless.

I have stayed at MANY hotels located adjacent to airports in the past that have not been this bad. The key difference is that consumer flights do not start until 6:00 AM in the worst case and do not fly nearly as frequently as a Fed-Ex Hub evacuating it's cargo.

We unpacked, went downstairs where, Sean, the conceirge, asked how everything was. Also asked him about the junior suites, not true, they are not all handicap accessible. He offered to have our stuff moved, but we chose to do it ourselves. Upstairs, repack, move, back downstairs. All of this could have been avoided if the front desk person would have be more properly informed. The rooms have taken some abuse in the last year. Furniture rather beat up, stained fabric, etc. The couch in the room is not comfortable at all. We had dual TV's, which proved to be interesting. Turn on one, the other one came on, manually turn one off, try to turn the other off while in bed, the other on turns on. The bathrooms are very cold and the shower caddy is useless as the amenities fall out through the slots. Sean, the conceirge, was very helpful as was Jonah, our bellhop.

As a woman, I felt very safe staying here and walking around the neighborhood. We went in November on a \"girls weekend\" to see the lighting of Michigan Avenue and participate in the festivities. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was plenty of hot water and water pressure. The decor is on the masculine side - which made it feel rather \"cold\" to me, and it was all very modern. I do wonder about the artwork in the bathroom that was a replica of a cover of Esquire magazine. All that aside, it was an okay place to stay - but for a Doubletree, I was surprised that there were no bathrobes in the room, no turn-down service, etc. Perhaps I was considered a \"sub customer\" due to the fact that I booked my room through a popular on-line travel service? Even the cookie that I was offered at check-in was not warmed. Come on, Doubletree - I know you can do better than this. I've stayed at other Doubletrees that offered all the above and more. Would I stay here again? Probably not - there are too many other choices in downtown Chicago that would probably be a bit more attentive to me as a customer, even on a busy weekend. But, it's not a horrible place to stay, either.

The hotel has a glorious swimming pool and serves great snacks and drinks from the pool bar.

It is in Clarke quay beside Robertson quay. The rooms are spotless and the bathroom and mini-bar well stocked. The staff are extremely courteous and friendly. Compared to other hotels which I researced this hotel was one of the best in relation to reviews and price. We never used the restaurant or the pool as we were too busy sight-seeing and as most of the restaurants in Clark quay and indeed Singapore are overpriced we tended to eat at the hawker centres etc....They are inexpensive and the service is quick. Mostly everything is cooked as you stand. Do buy duty free once landing at the airport as alcohol is a rip-off. Cost of a pepsi is aprox £5 at a pub and this does not include any alcohol. Beer is around £7 for a glass (not pint). The GRT is only a 15 min walk away and is necessary to get around. It is easy to use and inexpensive.Certainly if you want a very clean hotel at a good price (for Singpore) stay at PARK HOTEL CLARK QUAY. Go to the Fairmont Hotel for the best view from the highest hotel in Singapore. The new Asia bar. Happy hours until 9pm .

If you do stay here avoid room 219 as it is next to a gents toilet (not a problem in itself) but the flush is noisy and, of course, the toilet can be used at any time of the day or night.

The breakfasts are great (you may have to queue to get your eggs cooked) and there is a good choice to suit most tastes. The basics are the same each day - but there is always something different each day (I've never had curried chickpeas for breakfast before - but they were well worth trying)!!!

The hotel itself is very nice - front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, rooms and common areas were quite clean and comfortable. Even the business center was nice, with 3 computers and printing services. Several options for lunch\/dinner within walking distance, and I felt safe walking around. We called from the airport to request shuttle pickup, and the shuttle arrived within 15 minutes. The included breakfast was your average hotel breakfast - though I've had better options at other Fairfield Inns around the country. The reason I'm giving this hotel a 2-star rating is because of the noise level in the room. Sure, you can hear the planes taking off - this is to be expected. The problem was that there was some kind of club\/restaurant nearby that played extremely loud music until at least 2am. We were on the top floor of the hotel - where presumably the street noise would be at its quietest - and it sounded like the band was right in our room. We had to blast the A\/C and keep the tv on all night at a medium volume to drown out the bass. This was on a Friday night. I know the hotel can't control what other nearby properties do, but this was ridiculous. Fair warning to those looking to book on a weekend night! The other problem we had was with the shuttle service to the port on the morning of our cruise. We had a shuttle reservation for 12pm, so we took our time getting ready that morning. The shuttle driver called our room at 10:40, begging us to switch to the 11am shuttle! He said that the original 12pm shuttle we were booked on was definitely going to be running late, and that we needed to be on the 11am shuttle to be safe. We felt very rushed and were confused about why this was happening. I'm thinking this was probably a random, one-time thing - but I wanted to report my experience. This hotel was nice, but I won't be staying here again - I book hotels because I want to sleep at them, not listen to club music all night.

I went with a friend and our intentions were to choose a nice, clean, safe and economical hotel close to Disney, and this was a last minute choice, however, a good choice. The hotel is pretty big, with tower rooms on one side and rooms overlooking one of their pools on the other. Unfortunately, we didn't get to really venture out into the hotel and look around and see everything they had to offer, because Disney would tire us out and we'd leave early morning and come back late at night. Before staying here, I read the suggestions that the tower is the place to stay, and that's where we did. The room was nice and spacious for two young females. It came equipped with a fridge, microwave and storage space to put groceries; we definitely made use of each. A problem with our room was the ac...it would come on\/off when it wanted. Honestly, the hotel was pretty bare. It wasn't really active; we didn't see it thriving with people, but that was fine with us. The only time we'd see a huge amount of people at one time was in the morning, waiting for the shuttle to Disney parks. There was a restaurant, and a diner type of food area, we didn't try either, due to the fact that we had purchased food at the Walmart, enough to last us the 5 days we were there for. The pool area that is overlooked by the pool area rooms was pretty bare-hardly anyone out there. In addition, I wanted to clear up some things that were said in some of the reviews: 1) Walmart and\/or Target are not within walking distance, we actually had to drive about 15-20 mins to get to a Walmart. 2) The outlets (international drive) and universal are not close by. 3) We didn't encounter any \"sticky fingered\" maids, ours were pretty nice. If your intention is to go out to Citywalk every night be prepared to spend around 40$ on a taxi each way from this hotel. All in all the hotel was a great, economical stay, but if you search to have a night life and party it up, this area isn't really the best for that.","date":"2014-11-27 23:44:31 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":3,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":5}},{"author":"Clare Mante","content":"We stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night after spending the day at Disney.

We were due to arrive the Saturday before but ran into a lot of traffic coming from Massachusetts. I called the hotel and told them we were running late. They told me no worries and they would see us when we got there. The check in procedure was very easy and went very fast. We arrived at 2:30am on Sunday. They got us into our room very fast as we were very tired. The security gaurd actually helped us find our room and helped us get in. I would agree it's somewhat of a maze but was happy for the help. We stayed in the motel side that night but decided to upgrade to the tower later Sunday. The room was fine but the kids wanted to use the elevator. The staff was more than willing to accommodate. The pools were very nice and the breakfast buffet was more than worth it having two children. ( kids eat free) the grounds were always kept nice and I saw no trash anywhere.

I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and claim the bad reveiws as isolated events. Well, that did not happen to me. For a Ramada it was a motel and NOT a hotel. The carpets were filthy! We stayed for a week during spring break. After a few days I discovered bites on my body which I attributed to the 7 mosquitos in our room. (Which is no fault of the Ramada, since my husband left the door open. We killed them all.) But it was the bites that showed up in places that were not exposed outside the blankets that puzzles me. Bed bug bites! If you remove the linen and look at the corner crevaces of the mattress, you can see the signs. The staff was nice, but not helpful with information about the hotel. The beds were comfortable but a very noisy hotel. Also to use the internet you have to pay 25 cents a minute!

The Ramada Inn in Kissimee room was alot nicer. The outside pool area was not as nice at the one in Ft. Lauderdale. The variety of food on the buffets were better as well.

Only downside was no nets on the windows so curtains had to stay closed so quite dark. But the the price-great! Great position, 1 stop down to entrance to Disney and close to I4 for Universal. We had a late check out at 1pm with no charge !! All in all we had a great time ! Also we got to see Harry Potter and my son was chosen by the wand keeper - excellent.

So we, and quite a few others, rented rooms which included a suite to gather in and webcast from (for those who could not attend). To begin with, we had asked for early check-in yet had to wait for hours in the lobby so they could \"clean the room\". When we got to the suite it reeked of chlorox, yet it wasn't clean. There were ants all over the place (this was in the \"newer\" section). When we told housekeeping about the ants, they just came and sprayed more chlorox which did nothing to the ants. The refrigerator was dirty and wobbly, and the cabinet doors wouldn't close because they fit so poorly. The kitchen area floor was dirty, and housekeeping did not give us clean glasses each day, instead they just rinsed (no, not washed) the ones we had from day 1. We had to use the shampoo samples to wash our cups and glasses ourselves. The topper for us came when we tried to hook up a laptop, and discovered no wifi connection. Wouldn't be a problem, except that we had only taken the suite so we could gather to webcast to those who couldn't attend. The hotel staff lied to us day after day saying that someone was on site working on it, that it would be fixed later that day. Well after 6 days of waiting we were finally told by the company that services the internet for Ramada Gateway\/Westgate that the internet was down due to a broken part, which for some reason was not available. Had we known, we would never have taken the suite, in fact we would not have taken the hotel. Seems we are the ones who got taken. They only gave us a credit of $20 a night. Seems strange to me that they would charge us $.25 a minute to use the lobby computer, yet not credit us for that same amount because it was not available in our suite. Stay here again??

My wife & I have just returned from a holiday to Orlando staying at the Ramada Plaza hotel in Kissimmee, This is our review. Reading the past reviews on this hotel ranging from '$@!#%' to 'good value for money', We arrived with some in trepidation on what to expect. Well generally the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Booking in was quick and we were directed straight to the 'motel' room (141) accommodation on the ground floor, (not the tower rooms, where reviews have always seemed more favourable) Our room also had handy car parking right outside the room. (Not always a good thing, as you will read later). Our room was very clean, had 2 large queen size beds, nicely made up, the bathroom had a bath, shower and toilet, plenty of fresh towels and a separate sink area. This also had a small but adequate fridge, ironing board, an iron, hair dryer, all working. There was a large TV (with free and pay as you view options). A small table and 2 chairs, and 2 adequate sized chest of draws. So we were pleasantly pleased with the room. Beds were made up every day but not with fresh sheets, these were changed once a week, but towels were changed daily. Now for the down side. Being on the Ground floor, and discovering later we were situated close to a hotel maintenance room, we found there was little regard for those trying to sleep. On a few occasions we had the need to report noisy staff congregating outside the maintenance rooms after 11 at night and on our first night a large delivery vehicle left its engine running for over half an hour after midnight outside the room, while the driver chatted with staff. A phone call to reception on each occasion did restore the peace, but I cant help wondering if this was a coincidence & It did not prevent similar issues on subseqent nights. Each morning we were woken early by the movement of maintenance and laundry trolleys being pushed along the path outside the room from 7:30am onwards, and during the 1st week our room maid knocked on the door at 8:00am to see if we were out. Not Impressed! Vehicles parking up and driving off at all hours of the night also presented a problem especially for a ground floor room, so be warned. If it wasn’t for the fact we were so very tired after the resort trips it would of been a greater issue. We should of realised that after the first problem we should of asked to move, But we were reluctant to change as the room was nice,the parking convinient and you never know what you will end up with. If I could of got a tower room, I would of done so, but these always seemed to be full. Both pools were small, clean and adequate for a quick dip. The pool surrounds were nice and the gardens well kept. There were always a free lounges to use when we were there and clean pool towels available. Be advised that there were some motel style rooms next to the heated pool and games area, which could present some unwanted noise, but great if you have kids. So in a nutshell, the hotel is generally very good for the money, its not luxury so don’t expect it. Staff were helpful and friendly. Its excellent located for the Disney Resorts, Only 10 mins from the closest (MGM). There are local amenities (shops, restaurants etc) right outside the hotel if you need them. I never went up the tower, but I would recommend a room there based on what we got and the reviews on these rooms, or at least be very choosy on what you get if they give you a motel room. I would use them again but would be more wary of my room location next time. If anyone wants any information on this Hotel or generally about holidaying to Orlando or the resorts then please feel free to contact me.","date":"2013-11-28 00:58:55 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3,"Check in \/ front desk":3,"Cleanliness":3,"Location":4,"Overall":2,"Rooms":3,"Service":3,"Value":2}},{"author":"Lelah Blick","content":"-Staff are a mixed bunch.

The staff was friendly and helpful (save for one of the women who took care of the breakfast area - no smile or personality and needed to be a bit more attentive to cleaning tables and spills). On the other hand, they have one of the better continental breakfasts that we have experienced at a hotel. You can tell they are trying to do a good job. The building may be a little old but it is obvious they have made renovations, painted and decorated nicely, especially the lobby, which was also comfortable. The rooms were clean and bright and despite being on a busy and noisy thoroughfare, it was quiet. We had a good nights sleep every night. There is a nice Indian Restaurant next to the hotel that we liked and they provide room service. There is a Starbucks (of course they are everywhere) and convenience store across the street. A mall, with many different restaurants, is within walking distance. This is not a luxurious hotel and some people my not care for the exterior, balcony access to the rooms.

Better than looking at the backside of stores on the backside of the hotel. The front side once you get in your room is very quiet. The rooms are very large and we had plenty of space to put out 4 suitcases and carry on's and spread out a bit even. Bathroom is a bit small, however there is a 15 minute timer heat lamp for when you get out of the shower or bath which is very nice. Water pressure is great and temperature can be as hot or cold as you want it. The vanity area is nice, but the sink pressure is a bit weak and the water is split out into a lot of small jets instead of one stream. Big plus in the room is the small refrigerator and microwave along with a coffee maker. We did not use the last 2 items but the refrigerator was great! Airco\/heater units are a bit dated, but quiet and cool or heat your room pretty fast. Check in was simple and fast even when arriving at 8pm at night. The first room we got had a problem with the bottom of the door,which the maintenance guy on duty said he could not fix on his shift and went back to the front desk and got us another room within 5-10 minutes. We had 2 other minor issues which were responded to quickly during the day. Houskeeping starts at 8am, but does not check occupied rooms until after 9am. Very friendly staff and they keep the rooms spotless during your stay. Check out was fast, but the bell carts were nowhere to be found and a housekeeping person had to go look for one which took 10-15 minutes. That was the only down side. Wireless internet is fast in the room with excellent signal strength as there is a repeater on every floor. There are 2 older desktop pc's in the lobby that are free to use, however being public pc's there is no privacy programs to erase your history or filed in field entries. The CPU fans get very noisy when there are a lot of graphics being displayed. However web browsing is very fast! No charge to use them or to print documents out. A very nice thing to have. Lobby was spotless and modern and lots of daylight. Continental breakfast is good, you can make you own \"Belgian\" waffles, fresh fruit, eggs of various styles each day and bacon or sausage to go with them. Menu varies each day with waffles being the main item. Coffee and juice are also available. Wireless internet if you need it, with plug in's around the walls. Big screen TV's tuned to CNN. Breakfast is from 6-10am each day. We did not use the restaurant. Location is great, just off of I-5 at Northgate. Short distance to the mall from the hotel. A bit of a walk or a short drive with the car.

I'm assuming they farmed it out as the restaurants and the casino seemed so un-Marriott like. We had the breakfast buffet at the restaurant closest to the front desk (can't remember the name right now). They had omelette station, waffle maker, and fresh pancakes. Other than that, the buffet overall was pretty disappointing as far as selection goes. We loved the gigantic pool. It was 3 1\/2 feet deep in the majority of the pool which was perfect for me 7 year old, but a bit too deep for my 5 year old. There are two hottubs as well.

I could not believe how big the standard room was. There was so much room I almost felt like they wasted space - but I'm not complaining. The bathroom was so luxurious. We used the whirlpool tub every day we were there. PROS: - Huge room - Awesome shower and whirlpool tub - Very classy common areas and beautiful landscape - Nice view of the mountains - Restaurant Row (connected to the resort) had a variety of different types of food - American cafe, Starbucks, Japanese like Benihana, buffet, Irish pub, Italian, as well as the hotel's standard restaurant Ceres - we ate at the Promenade Cafe which had the standard coffee shop type of menu and all three times we went the food was superb. We also ate at the Japanese restaurant and it was good. Each morning we had breakfast at the Ceres restaurant. The buffet was standard. I've had better. We decided to order off the menu for breakfast and both dishes were wonderful. - Nice sized casino - We're not gamblers so I didn't choose this hotel for the casino scene, but it was a nice size. I actually won $50 at blackjack. It was nice to see $5 tables on a weekend night. In the past, the other hotels on the strip only seemed to offer $25 minimum tables. - The pool was closed for the season, but I would definitely come back to try out the pool. - Clean and classy - Overall good service from everyone we met CONS: I can't really think of any cons except that maybe the towels and pillows didn't smell fresh, but I understand some people don't like a scent in their pillows. Not a big deal at all and not a real complaint. We weren't interested in going to the Strip, but it didn't seem that far to me, especially if you have your own car.

The person at the front desk was nice and helpful and even though it was early we got our room right away. The Room: We had a room on the 23rd floor that overlooked the pool, the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio fountains, very nice. The room itself was clean however the sheets were a little worn to the point there were some holes in them. The bathroom was a nice size, larger than most. The Pool: The pool gets plenty of sun, we were in the sun by 10:30 a.m. Doesn't seem to get very crowded which was nice. But by most Vegas pool standards, it was a bit quiet. And here is the part of the hotel I didn't like...the drinks at the pool were expensive. I got a large (but not that large) Bloody Mary and it was $18. Later I took that cup to have some ice put in it and they want to charge you $1.50 for ice. Never heard of such a thing and I hate being nickle & dimed. If I'm paying to stay at the hotel and paying $18 for a drink I feel I should be able to get ice without having to pay for it. This totally turned me off of this hotel. I have never stayed anywhere where you had to pay for ice. If seemed to be a general complaint of most people around the pool. Some people were going to the ice machines on the floors and coming out with ice in a bag. The food at the pool restaurant was okay but the service was horrendous. The waitress could barely speak English and seemed to have trouble understanding it, she had to bring someone over to help her.

As a Francophile, I had always wanted to stay there just for kicks, and we also booked the trip through Travelocity and received two-for-one tickets to see Penn & Teller. Paris is just like every other hotel on the Strip in that you have to weave your way through what feels like acres of slot machines and stores to get to the guest elevators, but once you make it to your room, they're quite comfy and nice. Ours had a nice, big bathtub that I wasn't able to take advantage of, and a spacious shower. (I tend to gauge hotels by their bathrooms... this one was excellent... it even had a sweet ceramic hair dryer that made me want to come home and splurge on one. :) ) One of the things I loved about Paris is the pool right under the Eiffel Tower. We were less than impressed with the service at the poolside restaurant for breakfast (it took an hour for french toast and a breakfast burrito), but we heard other patrons saying that just the day before they had received very speedy service, so we are pretty sure that part was a fluke. The staff were very friendly, and there are many, many food and shopping options in the casino, all laid out in a quaint French avenue setup. Having been in most of the casinos in the central part of the Strip, I found the setup at Paris the easiest to navigate and most convenient... but that could just be because I like imagining I'm back in the real Paris. :)","date":"2015-05-08 17:27:49 +0300","ratings":{"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Value":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.dentonhouse-keswick.co.uk\/","vacancy":true}

I did revisit the property under my fiancee's name and SPG acct so that we wouldnt get any special consideration due to speaking with Jim....happy to say that we had a great time...were given a great upgraded room (my Fiancee is also a platinum SPG so upgrade was available)...staff was very friendly and room service was quik \"and' good....now remember this is a Niteclub venue as well...and you should know that when booking your resv...the hotel tries its best to accomodate its guests in regards to the venue and the pool but as in LV, the venue also has a greater degree of control on access etc so make nice to the venue mgrs via the hotel staff or the WW staff... Pool is a bit small but has a goood vibe and yes lots n lots of beautiful people....even some that were never invited to the party,,lol yes the curb and valet staff do need some work and some lessons on manners but remember most of them its their first job and with a property like the W they probably wont last long or wil be trained appropriately as time goes on...remember staff reflects mgmt and the Mgmt there definately wants to put its best foot forward so suffice to say that nothing is perfect but sometiems a willingness to be perfect is just as good... i will definately recommend W Hollywood to my friends....my only regret is that i didnt get to meet Jim McPartlin (GM) sooner as he is a great guy who has had to practically re learn his job to deal with all of the new age way of running a Niteclub Venue Hotel and i must say he has done a wonderful job...The good thing is that he will be going to the W NYC soon so since we are there often i am sure that we will still be able to enjoy another venue run by a Top Notch W Veteran such as Jim....

It is nestled in the hills and has views of the ocean. We stayed in the new building - our room was comfortable, clean and nicely decorated with a large balcony overlooking the swimming pool. There is a casual, friendly feel to the place and it was a nice contrast to the large resort in San Juan where we had stayed. The pool is nice but the hot tub was cold during our visit. There are 2 restaurants, one outdoors by the pool which has a decent menu and good food. We did not eat at the restaurant upstairs which is a little more formal but the menu looked inviting. There are some lovely outdoor tables set in little secluded areas. There are 2 cages with parrots and love birds that our kids loved. Our stay included continental breakfast which again was eaten by the pool. While waiting for our dinner the first night, our kids played with other kids around the pool area while we chatted with other guests. It was definately relaxing for us and our children. On the downside, when we arrived, we had already been in Peurto Rico for a week and had three big pieces of luggage. We had to lift them up a flight of stairs, then down a series of steps at the other side and then up two flights of stairs to our room!!! I asked if there was anyone to help with bags and was told no! On our departure, we discovered that we could drive down the side of the inn and bring our bags out by the bar but that still involved lugging them down two flights. Also, on our first night, the ice machine was out of ice and the blender to make frozen drinks was broken. The second night we stayed, there was an engagement party by the pool and some other event going on and the place was crowded. We placed our order for dinner shortly before 8pm and at 8:40pm were told that they were out of one of the items that we ordered. I ordered a salad instead (thinking it would be quick) but by 9pm still no food and one of our kids had fallen asleep. At that point, we cancelled our order and went to our room. There was music blaring by the pool until 11pm which was right underneath our balcony. This may have been a once off - the waiter was really haried - but it might be worth checking with them if there are any parties scheduled during your stay. Also, there is a small step-up going from the pool area to the breakfast area that is not that obvious and we noticed a few people trip over it. On the morning we were leaving, a woman fell over it dropping a glass plate and landed on a piece of broken glass that went into her knee. This is a definate hazard that could be easily rectified by painting the step up a bright color. Pool hours are only from 10am to 6pm but did not seem to be strictly enforced. Our kids are early risers and bugged us from 8am to go in the pool but we did not permit them because of the rule. We were more comfortable with breaking it when other guests were swimming in the pool outside these hours. You also need your own towels to bring to the beach, which we did not know. On the whole, we loved the ambiance and the casual laid back feel at the Lazy Parrot. I think we were unfortunate on our second night and that this may have been an anomoly. We would give it another try.","date":"2013-04-03 03:57:43 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3,"Check in \/ front desk":3,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":2,"Overall":3,"Rooms":4,"Service":3,"Value":4}},{"author":"Missouri Boehm","content":"We stayed for one night on our PR tour and I wish it had been for longer.

The facility and grounds were fine and enjoyable but the room was totally NOT what I expected from a Hilton Resort. Our room was in the main tower on the 5th floor and I hated it from the moment we walked in. It is old and dated and in desperate need of a facelift. I have stayed here in the past (which is why I decided to stay here again) but it was nothing like I remember. It was very disappointing and I highly doubt if I would ever stay here again. For what we were paying I expected better accommodations. I have stayed at other Hilton Hotels and at least you felt like you were getting your money's worth even if it was not an executive suite ! This room does not hold a candle to those. I attempted a room change but was told by the staff member who checked us in that unfortunately there was nothing else available and would not be for a few days. Let's see where do I begin. On top of the fact that the room had seen better days, the TV did not work properly with or without the remote. The dresser had a door in front of it that was loose and coming off the hinges. We complained about both and they sent two people up to fix the door but the TV problem was NEVER resolved. At first they blamed it on the cable company, then on the remote, then on the TV itself. (however our friends across the hall had no problem with their TV from the start). Let's see what else...the air conditioning was difficult to control. One minute we were hot and the next we were freezing. We had a problem with the tub because the water would not drain properly. The bathroom also had loose fixtures. I spent the first four days trying to correct the various problems with the front desk staff and several managers. One manager explained that this is an old hotel and they are in the process of renovating...but it's a very slow process. The maintenance staff must be pretty busy round the clock ! We did however like the facilities, spa, and grounds. We were traveling with a 14 year old who enjoyed the pool. Most of the staff were polite and pleasant. All I can say is please heed the warnings on this website and do not be fooled by pretty pictures on the internet. For what they are charging, unless you are planning on staying in one of the executive suites (which I understand are much nicer)....go somewhere else !","date":"2013-06-19 02:31:37 +0300","ratings":{"Check in \/ front desk":3,"Cleanliness":3,"Location":3,"Overall":2,"Rooms":1,"Service":3,"Value":2}},{"author":"Tobin Schroeder","content":"First let me start by saying that my girlfriends and I were kind of weary about going to Puerto Rico (which I must say turned out to be the most beautiful place and fun), much less about the hotel. But since I waited a little too late for my passport, we chose to go ahead and go. After much carousing and reviewing of all the different hotels in San Juan, we settle on the Caribe Hilton. We really didn't know what to expect because some of the reviews were very exceptional and some were down right anti-Caribe. We arrived in San Juan on Friday May 23rd and stayed until Tuesday May 27th. Upon arriving and checking in at the Caribe Hilton I notified the check in desk that I was a Hilton Honors member and immediately got a free upgrade. I'm not sure were we where staying prior but we were upgraded to the Garden Towers on the 4th floor. The room had 2 bathrooms (only one had a shower), a king size bed and a pullout sofa bed in the living room. There was a television in each room. It came with a safe and refrigerator. It was nicely decorated and gave you the feel of apartment living. We had 2 separate balconies with an entrance to each one. The view was partial garden and partial ocean, which was very nice. After we settled down into the room, two of us decided to go downstairs to one of the hotel restaurants to eat. We chose Palmeras...which was a great thing....because every Friday they have an all you can eat Seafood buffett (great for those seafood lovers). They had sauteed lobster ready to eat, stone crab claws sauteed ready to eat, fried shrimp, baked fish, cold boiled shrimp, various choices of salads with seafood...it was AMAZING. Yes, it was a little pricey...about $52 per person, but it was worth every bit of the price. While we were eating we did have a small incident take place back at our room. The other young lady left behind in the room had a nice surprise when she stepped out of the shower. There was another set of guest sitting in the living room. After trying to straighten it out herself (hard due to language constraints), I paid a visit to the front desk and spoke with the manager. She kindly apologized, changed the keys and gave us a $75.00 credit towards our room. This really did come in handy because it just about covered our tab at the restaurant. Each day was a new adventure at the hotel. There was the lively breakfast buffet that Palmera had every morning, not to mention a great menu selection too. Did I mention how awesome the wait staff is in this restaurant, especially Efrim, he's very attentive and as a guest you will not lack quality service. Then there's the mimosa's served that you could take by the pool area and layout. The pool area was absolutely beautiful and spacious. Several pools to choose from. There was small private beach, however, alongside of the Caribe's property was a public beach and there were a lot of visitors. The Caribe offered the rental of paddle boats at the hotel to take out on the water. There were water activities going on in the private area of the beach. It was great. There was never a shortage of cabs in the front of the hotel. Or you could walk 2 blocks and catch the city bus to Old San Juan to get there in 10 minutes for only .75 cents and it lets you off right by the cruise docks. The great part about this hotel is the location. It's not in the middle of all the Old San Juan hustle and bustle and it's not part of the Isla Verde fast paced strip. You can have quiet and then you can take a cab or bus to the busy areas in under 10 minutes. Any time of night or day. A great perk about this hotel is not just the boutiques that are located there in the hotel or the modern openness of the lobby, but it's the great convenience of the Starbucks. Located in the downstairs lobby. Great for the late night recoveries. Go downstairs get a cup of mojo and go back to the room to wake up. Lastly I can not go without mentioning how great the room service and housekeeping was. We were never short of towels and if we happened to use to many (because women do that sometimes) we called housekeeping for more and in a matter of 15 minutes we would have our fresh towels. We put in a late night call to room service for a request of a microwave, within a matter of 20minutes we had a microwave set up in our room, free of charge. The staff was great, service was great, ambiance was one of a kind. I will definitely be staying at the Caribe Hilton the next time I visited Puerto Rico, hands down!","date":"2013-03-09 08:14:11 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Johanna Spencer","content":"I stayed at the Caribe Hilton from May 5th - May 8th. I liked a lot of things about the hotel (the open-air lobby, the Starbucks, the cleanliness of the rooms and the tropical garden) but there were a few issues: 1) There was no one at the check-in desk when I arrived. If you were Hilton Honors or a VIP your line was staffed but there was no one there for normal check-ins. Not the best first impression. 2) Room service trays and garbage were not picked up promptly from the hallways. When my next door neighbor had dinner his tray of half-eaten food remained outside the room until lunchtime the next day. This happened more than once. 3) Beach service was spotty. One day there was someone taking orders but the next day there was no one to be seen. I don't mind getting up to get my drinks and food but sometimes you just want to veg out and not move. 4) Food and drink prices are extraordinarily high. $10 for a Bud Light! That's ridiculous. 5) There needs to be a higher level of attentiveness to guests from some of the staff. One evening when I tried to get a cab to take me to the casino at the El San Juan Hotel, it took 5 minutes of standing around before the staff stopped chatting with each other to ask if they could help. All in all, I had a great trip because the weather in PR was wonderful and the beach at the hotel was really all I needed for a relaxing stay. Would I stay here again?

I stayed in the Villas with 3 of my friends ( 3rd floor w\/ ocean view). The bedroom is an okay size- 2 queen beds, nice bathroom and nice balcony view of the condado. The kitchenette is cute, it includes a small fridge, sink, microwave, cabinets, and counter space. Bedroom Cons: not much floor space for luggage, no WIFI (which was a HUUUUGE disappointment). I couldn't believe that in 2008 Hilton didn't have WIFI in the bedrooms. But we were able to pick up the WIFI from the Condado Plaza Hotel (Mariott- i think) across the water. So make sure you know how to use your phone as a modem or bring some type of wireless card if you go. (they only have free WIFI in the lobby). Room service is really expensive Bedroom Pros: Nice clean linen, nice size bathroom, nice balcony, good service. You can also buy food and store it in the cabinets and fridge. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Hilton was not as glamorous as I thought it would be, but it is nice. The lobby was clean and it's kind of cool how it's connected to the outside- meaning that when you arrive to the hotel you get out of your car and automatically step into the lobby. The pool and beach area is great, simply nice. Its not grandeur, but its very extensive- the property includes alot: gardens, pools, jacuzzis, beaches, playground area, bars, decks, ponds, exotic fish and animals and more- I was not able to fully explore this area, but my friends were able to and they LOVED it. It's a great place for couples at night. The villas has its own separate lobby which is really small, but its somewhat convenient when you need help and information. But I did NOT like all the construction being built - because of the construction going on outside the lobby of the Villas, the outside of the villa area was ugly (very gray and gloomy). Overall Hilton Pros: perfect location- the Hilton seems to be in the middle of everything (Old San Juan (5 minutes away), the Condado (5 minutes away), Isla Verde(12 minutes away), Airport (15 minutes away) plus its a low traffic area so we barely got caught in traffic (which is everywhere in PR), the Hilton pool and beach area offers the widest variety of things to do, and nice people. Overall Hilton Cons: all the Construction, no WIFI, not very glamorous, lack of floor space in rooms w\/ 2 beds Most people say the Hilton is overpriced, but I personally think you are paying for the location over anything else b\/c the hotel itself is not very ritzy- it's sort of aesthetically disappointing, but you have to keep in mind that this is Hilton's first hotel in the Caribbean (they actually consider it historic) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I also visited The Ritz, El San Juan Hotel, and the Intercontinental. The Ritz's beach was very disappointing and dirty.The intercontinental lobby, beach, and pool area was really pretty (i visited at night), but they all seemed kind of small (and their Casino is really small, but busy). El San Juan Hotel is the hot spot- the lobby is BEAUTIFUL and very grand i felt like i was in a fashion magazine- EVERY person there was BEAUTIFUL. It is veeeerry busy, so if you want to watch alot of beautiful people-go there. If you ever visit that hotel (especially at night) be sure to have your best and most fashionable clothes on w\/ makeup & hair done etc. (women should wear dresses that compliment their body types with heels and men should just look clean and smell good). If you want to live the \"high life\" you should stay at a hotel like El San Juan, but if you want to relax you should stay at a hotel like the Hilton. El San Juan Hotel is sort of a place for single people (their are too many temptations there especially for men) and other hotels are better for couples and families. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OVERALL Puerto Rico Advice: First off, I lost my camera in a taxi on the first night which made me really sad (b\/c i lost over 200 pics) and put a little damper on my trip. So I greatly advise everyone to find one taxi driver and stick with them throughout your stay (be sure to ALWAYS get their name, number, and taxi number or license plate). But moreover to Truly experience Puerto Rico you should rent a car. After my experience I advise you to use taxi's for a day, then drive after that- you can get more done and you feel more free! Places to visit: 1. Old San Juan is a must at night (eat at a great restaurant and walk around and visit a club or three) 2. The rain forest (this was probably the best day we had in Puerto Rico- it was BEAUTIFUL!)- bring water and\/or drinks, oh and good shoes 3. Culebra, Vieques, or Gilligans Island - you MUST visit one of the three (but visiting one of those will be an all day trip because you will need to arrive early and take ferries to them (so be sure to bring snacks, drinks, snorkel equipment, and an umbrella). 4. Forts in Old San Juan (Fort San Cristobal is better than el Morro) 5. For young people: -Isla Verde at night is a must, definitely go to the clubs, bars, and El San Juan Hotel -Senor Frogs (old san juan), Brava (el san juan hotel), and just ask around. . . (Vibes seemed nice, but we didnt get to go) 6. The Condado at night is really pretty too, when we went there were singers and performers on the big lawn\/park area. 7. Ponce is a nice area with many historic places, gardens, etc. . .(old french town so it looks different from old San Juan). You should plan before you get there b\/c its very easy to go astray and not get as much done as you want. Remember that EVERYTHING closes early (around 6pm) so tourist activities MUST be planned early and they must be done during the day. At night Old San Juan, the Condado, and Isla Verde are the best. . .If you drive be very cautious b\/c people drive very loose down there. Though Puerto Rico is an American territory - 75% of the people their speak Spanish ONLY -if not more. So you should have a basic knowledge of spanish and download some type of translation program on your phone (i just used babelfish.altavista.com- which is an online translator). Walgreens are everywhere (and that will be your grocery and everything else store during the trip (we went almost everyday:-). --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall I LOVED Puerto Rico and I was not ready to go back after 5 days, I felt like I needed atleast 1 or 2 more days. I loved how racism and colorism just seemed to go out the window and everyone loved\/liked each other for who they were and respected everyone's individual beauty. So don't be a typical stiff American when you go- relax, have fun, talk to random people no matter their background, race, or ethnicity. Most phone companies don't charge for using your phone in Puerto Rico, but call and make sure. Okay, I think my review is long enough. . . Vive (las) Puerto Rico! lol. . . . Adios! *make sure your camera has a strap on it and put your name and number on it- I would hate for anyone else to lose their camera. * you'll easily notice that most Puerto Ricans seem to be in relationships b\/c everywhere you go there will be couples *as an attractive dark-skin woman of color i felt sooo Beautiful in Puerto Rico, everywhere i went i was told how gorgeous i was, not only by Puerto Rican men (and even some women) but by many white Americans (people seem to lose their prejudices in Puerto Rico)- this made my trip even better- i felt like a Goddess there:-)","date":"2013-01-04 21:29:46 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":1,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Value":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.shetland.gov.uk\/islesburgh\/Hostel.asp","vacancy":false}

I read the many \"mixed\" reviews about this hotel and others before making our reservation. There were positive and negative reviews for almost all the hotels we considered. Based on the negative reviews of some of the older rooms at the Hilton, I called the hotel directly and reserved a renovated room in the Tower. We were thrilled with the room....ocean and lagoon view, fabulous walk-in glass enclosed shower, king size bed). Our package included the daily breakfast buffet (fantastic), plus free access to their nice fitness center. We rented a car and thought the location was great (it's the closest resort style hotel to Old San Juan) and also has easy access to Condado. The Hilton has beautiful grounds, a wonderful resort type pool and private beach....but don't go to San Juan expecting fabulous Caribbean beaches...you would need to go to resorts in other parts of Puerto Rico for those beaches. The meals at the hotel were good but pricey. We had dinner twice at Aqua Viva, a seafood restaurant in Old San Juan, and loved it! We also found the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful. The original part of the Caribe Hilton was built around 1950 and has a nice history...one of the first major resorts in the Caribbean....and hosted stars like Frank Sinatra....they also invented the Pina Colada here. Although extensively renovated over the years...from some of the other reviews...it sounds like some of the older physical infrastruture is showing its age. Evidently Hilton originally leased the land under the hotel from Puerto Rico....and finalized an agreement a few years ago to actually purchase the land. They are building new condo's on the hotel grounds which will be part of the Hilton. Next to that....as you look toward downtown...will be an upscale urban mall\/shopping area, a casino....and eventually a \"river walk\" along the lagoon leading downtown and to the new Convention Center. We loved our stay at the Hilton and would definitely go back. A friend of ours always stays at the Ritz Carlton (near the airport) which seems (by the reveiws) to be the nicest hotel in San Juan. However, we wanted to be closer in town.","date":"2013-06-18 17:40:12 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Overall":5,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Richmond Eichmann","content":"My boyfriend and I (both 26) stayed at this hotel for one night on July 31 before a cruise. When we booked the hotel in April we were worried because of reviews we saw here but we opted to stay here anyway and we were very happy we did. We arrived around 5pm and our room was not ready yet but we were able to check our bags and explore the grounds a bit and were given free drink coupons so we were not too bothered by our delay getting into our room. When the room was ready I was pleasently surprised that our particular room looked exactly like the pictures on the website and I honestly could not find one thing to complain about. The room and bathroom were clean, the AC worked great, the bed was very comfy, and we experienced no bad odors at all. We went to Old San Juan for dinner which was great but I cannot really comment on the quality\/price of food at the hotel itself (I would highly recommend Buru though for great tapas in old san juan) The grounds were perfect. We quite enjoyed laying on a hammock on the beach late at night listening to the ocean while drinking mojitos! On Saturday we got up early and grabed coffee and a bite to eat at Starbucks which was in the lobby and then spent the morning on the beach which again was clean and perfect for getting some sun and having fun in the ocean. There are a few convienience type stores around the hotel as well as a Subway about a 3 minute walk away (a safe walk as well) Overall we were very impressed with this hotel and would have no problem recommending it to others to stay at before\/after a cruise. However, I probably would not recommed it to business travelers who may not be taking in the outdoor ammenites that this hotel has to offer. The hotel did not really seem to have it's act together in terms of check-in but it didn't really bother us too much as we were on vacation and were not about to let a delay in getting to our room get us down. Also, families may want to beware because of the lack of affordable food near by.","date":"2015-11-15 05:05:17 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":3,"Value":4}},{"author":"Miss Ursula Reilly","content":"I stayed at the Carbie Hilton May23-26 2005. I found it to be very nice but far from everything. Taking cabs everywhere gets expensive so you are stuck eating all your meals in the hotel. Breakfast at the Palmeras was terrible and when I complained they didn't even offer a discount or take anything off the bill. Your better off getting a muffin at the Starbucks located in the lobby of the hotel and saving yourself $40.00 the Palmeras charges for breakfast! The room in the new tower was great (King Deluxe Plus) beautiful bathroom, great view from room 1767! The staff was helpful and quick to fix the clogged toilet in our room. I went to the Wyndam Condado Plaza for dinner and gambling one night and next time would probably stay there because it's in the middle of everything!

We stayed there pre-cruise and post-cruise recently - and what a difference 7 days made! The first night was \"fair\" - room was not ready well after check-in time but we were compensated with a drink on the house for our inconvenience. The bar service was very slow and what surprised me the most was that the servers at the bar were not allowed to handle cash and make change -- they had to take money to a cashier station to log their transaction before providing change - this made the process very tedious and slow -- this also designates that they have a trust issue with the bar staff - not good. The room was adequate - in the renovated tower, with sliding glass door and balcony with ocean view. Bed was very comfortable but leaking toilet kept us awake much of the night. Noticed peeling paint that was in need of repair. The service in the Palmeras restaurant that night was very good. Had an excellent cruise on Celebrity Constellation - topnotch service, all the way! What a downer to return to the Caribe Hilton post-cruise and experience an entirely different experience. The room was not ready (again) and this time no drink coupons (consistency?). We were in the \"old\" tower this time. The view was spectacular once again, however, what's with the old wooden rotted door from the 1950's leading our to the balcony? - and the rust stains on the carpet? - and more peeling paint? - (at least the toilet didn't leak this time) - but the bath was missing soap dish and more peeling paint in the bath area. In the hallway, there are housekeepers sitting on the floor. Dinner again at the Palmeras, but this time the service was awful. Server was rude and unattentive, but manager ended up comping our meal when we brought it to her attention. But the worst was yet to come: Upon returning to the room after an evening out in Old San Juan, went out on the balcony for a nightcap and a last look at the beautiful view. The old rotted wooden door closes behind us and LOCKS! - We are locked out on the 8th floor balcony at 4:00 am! - very scary, no one around, no security down below. We end up having to remove the old rotted panel at the bottom of the door to let ourselves back in. We call resident manager and ask to be moved to another room. They said they would patch up the door for the night instead. But after we explained all the other issues with our stay, we were moved to another room (in the \"new\" tower). I'll never forget the stay at Caribe Hilton and would never stay there again. (We paid $280\/night for this) -- True, the view is beautiful and the landscaping was impressive - but isn't it what's inside that counts sometimes? and the staff? and the management? - that's what's lacking at Caribe Hilton.","date":"2012-06-28 22:34:47 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":2,"Overall":1,"Rooms":1,"Service":1,"Value":1}},{"author":"Johnnie Crooks","content":"Stayed at the Caribe Hilton for a week from 1\/31\/05 to 2\/4\/05 and found it to be a good hotel but VERY overpriced.

The hotel has a nice beach and pool area but is not within walking distance of anything. Thats where the overpriced taxis come into play. If you must go to Puerto Rico, then this is a good choice among the hotels in San Juan (if you can get past the $18.50 breakfat buffet and $7 bottle of water from the mini bar).

This was my second time to visit Puerto Rico and I felt I had done my research about which hotels we might want to stay in as we wanted to stay in the Metro area. I had read a lot of the reviews on the Condado Hotel and felt there were more good ones than bad. I should have paid more attention to the bad ones. At least they fit our experience more than the good ones. We arrived on Sunday around 10:30 p.m. and I expected check in to go quickly as we had reservations and it was late in the evening. The hotel lobby looked as it had online in the photos. We had reserved a room with a private balcony overlooking the Atlantic with a king size bed. The room we were assigned had two double beds. So, down the slow elevators and back to the front desk where we had to wait to have this corrected. There were three people working the front desk, two of them were busy and the third one was staring at a computer screen and never looked up or asked us or anyone else if we needed help. So, we waited for the person that had originally helped us. The room assignment was corrected and we went back up to the new room. It was correct this time. The room also appeared as it had online but was not as clean as I had expected. The shower in the bathroom had mildew on the ceiling and the floor did not look vacuumed. The room also had a musty smell. There does not appear to be a ventilation fan in the bathroom. There was moisture on the window looking out to the balcony because of the humidity and you could see where some previous occupant of the room had written [--] You. You would think housekeeping could wipe the outside of the window between room occupants. The room seemed to be cleaned better after the first night. Note to traveler: make sure you put the â€œClean This Roomâ€� sign on your door when you leave your room in the morning. The other thing with housekeeping, which seemed to be the only friendly staff, was that they only put one wash cloth in the room everyday. There were two of us staying in the room and everyday I had to ask for another wash cloth. Back to the first 5 minutes in the room. We proceeded to get settled in the room and the power went out in the hotel. We were now standing in a dark room with just the glow through the window illuminating the room. I donâ€™t really blame this on the hotel but it was one of the first of many annoying things to come. After about 15 minutes of on again off again episodes and one scary moment of being stuck in the elevator for a brief moment power was restored. The pool area is ok but I have been to several that make this really rank. The pool is opened 24 hours but make sure you bring a towel from the room if you go down in the evenings or you will not have a towel They say they provide towels at the pool but the towel shack closes around 6:00 p.m. One night I had gone down to use the hot tub and lay by the pool and enjoy the moonlight and the sounds of the ocean and felt stalked by a security guard which kept looking and walking around me as if I didnâ€™t belong there. I almost confronted him and asked him to stop but decided to let it go. If you are going to have drinks at the pool bar be prepared to pay around $20 for two basic cocktails. Note to traveler: go to the store down the block and buy some rum, a bottle of coke and some plastic glasses and take your drink to the pool. Not one time did a waitress or waiter come over to ask if we needed a drink or anything. Another afternoon we had walked out to the pool area, set our things down and proceeded to the lagoon (beach) area to put our feet in the water and on the way back in we were stopped and asked to see the key card to our room to prove that we were hotel guest while other people just filed on by. Iâ€™m glad I had it in my swim suit pocket! I am 51 years old, clean cut and well dressed and had just walked out to the pool area from the hotel 5 minutes prior to this and he didnâ€™t say â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€� or explain why he was asking. Yes, I was insulted!!! After that we really didnâ€™t make use of the pool area. If you want to go to the beach go to Escambron, down the road towards Old San Juan, or Carolina beach in Isla Verde. Both are part of the Blue Flag program. If you go to El Yungue stop by Luquillo beach on your way back. We rented a car from Budget which is in the tower across the street also part of the Condado Hotel. The Budget Rental people were great. We got the car we wanted and quickly. We were able to return it at the airport which is what we wanted to do. Note to traveler: if you rent a car be prepared for the parking situation at the Condado. You have to take a ticket out of the machine to get in the parking garage, pray you can find a parking spot and then when you are ready to go out again you have to take it to the valet desk which is located outside in front of the hotel, write your room number, your name and sign it, hand it to a valet and get it validated and then go get your car out of the garage. You must do this every time you come and go which is very annoying! They do not explain this system well and sometimes it went smoothly and other times the person behind the parking desk acted like they didnâ€™t know what was going on and would tell you something completely different from what you had been doing. They tell you that in the end you will be charged a flat rate of $15.00 a day but this system does not instill confidence. We saw several people as confused as we were with the whole parking process. Also, just because you are a hotel guest does not mean you are guaranteed a parking space. There is an area designated for hotel guest but no one monitors who parks in these spots. If you come and go 3 to 4 times a day there are times you will return to the garage to see the â€œGarage Fullâ€� sign and have no option but to park down the street in a public lot or valet park at the hotel. We had no option but to valet park one time and when we came to get the car they didnâ€™t know where it was at first. Plus the valet parking rate is much more expensive. Note to traveler: if you have been out to a beach other than the one at the hotel there is no alternate elevator to your room you will have to go through the lobby. During the week with business men, etc. this can seem uncomfortable. We did not spend any time in the Casino as that is not our thing and we did not eat at the Strip House as we have one where we live. We did eat at the Italian restaurant which was not good. If you like Italian food donâ€™t get it here. You also can get breakfast in this same space in the morning and we ate breakfast twice and it was fine. If you like coffee, request the Puerto Rican coffee otherwise they bring regular coffee. We did try the bar but after no wait person came to take our order we went up to the bar to order and the bartender just continued to talk to someone and ignored us even after saying â€œcan we get a drink?â€� We gave up at that point. Another annoying thing at this hotel is the doors to the rooms. It is impossible to close them without a loud slam and I mean loud. So, early mornings and late evenings you are aware of the comings and goings of other guests while you are sleeping or relaxing in your own room. In general, I felt the staff was rude and unaccommodating. I think this is more of a business and convention hotel than a vacationing one. Based on our experience I was expecting check out to be an unpleasant experience and to our surprise it wasnâ€™t. We were in a long line waiting to get to the front desk when a very nice, official looking hotel representative asked if anyone was checking out and we indicated we were. He assisted us and even showed us where we could print our boarding passes for our flight home. This was the first time I felt we received the kind of service I had expected the 5 nights we stayed considering the quality and rating this hotel has or professes to have. Friday morning there was a political figure in town in addition to the people arriving at the hotel for the weekend and it really seemed like hotel staff had a wake up call. They even started to say â€œthank youâ€�. I know we were staying at this hotel during the â€œoff seasonâ€� but service is service. The second day of our trip we decided to salvage our vacation mood by lowering our expectations and proceeded to have a good vacation. I feel if we had stayed somewhere else we might have had a great vacation. I would not stay here again. Next time we will stay at one of the Isla Verde hotels or one of the resort hotels.","date":"2013-10-30 17:52:47 +0300","ratings":{"Check in \/ front desk":2,"Cleanliness":2,"Location":5,"Overall":2,"Rooms":2,"Service":2,"Value":2}},{"author":"Amina Barton","content":"The Condado was an excellent hotel.

They kick you out of your beach chairs to stack them up at 5:00 when there are still plenty of people enjoying them. The beach is $@!#% but it would still be okay if they serviced it. We waited an hour for our drinks the 1st day. After waiting an hour the 2nd day, we went up to the bar to get them ourselves only to find out the orders were never placed. This is where the service starts to really rank. I made a comment that the drinks really should be on the house at this point and was told to go speak to the manager which we did. He didn't apologize and he didn't comp us either. He asked us where we were sitting on the beach which led us to believe he would follow up with a round on the house. Nada. This ticked me off so I mentioned it at checkout. The woman at the desk called over and was told he would do nothing for us. I could've probably swallowed that if he'd have schmoozed out some kind of apology but we didn't even get that. The desk clerk suggested I complain on the online survey which I did and received ABSOLUTELY NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

I looked at all the reviews and had a pretty good idea of what to expect. I am happy to say that this place well exceeded my expectations. The cab ride from the airport was short, about 5 minutes. The cost is pre-determined, about $20 for 4 people with luggage. Upon arrival to the hotel, we found that only one of our rooms were ready and had to wait for a couple of hours for the other one. The front desk was very accommodating. They offered a temporary room so we could change into swimsuits and use the pool\/beach while we waited. Once we had our rooms, we were very pleased. Although we only had a street view from our balcony, the rooms were large and comfortable, with a huge bed, lots of space and had a nice sitting area. I can't say enough about the pool area. It was beautiful. I called my family back home and told them I found paradise!! The pool area was awesome with ample lounge chairs. Every spot is a good spot with good blend of sun and shade. (It was hot hot hot in November, so a little shade was welcome) The pool was the perfect temperature and was large enough to have a little corner of the pool to yourself without bumping into everyone else. There was a waterfall at one end that was a lot of fun to splash around. There is a boardwalk with a bar cafe that separates the pool from the beach. Although the beach isn't the best I've seen, it's still the ocean and loved having the option. There were a few tables of vendors selling jewelry and trinkets, not pushy at all and in fact I had to work my way thru the crowd of people around the tables to take a look for myself. The bad...restaurants were ridiculously expensive. We paid $10 for two cups of coffee to go and the breakfast was around $17 per person. There are a few restaurants in the area, but you mostly need to go to Old San Juan or elsewhere to get much of a variety. A cab ride is around $15-18, although we were able to bargain with the cabbies a little. You can also take a bus for around $1.25. Tip.. there is a large grocery store about 4 blocks from the hotel. We loaded up on soft drinks, snacks and rum to take back to the hotel. We also found a great mexican restaurant\/sports bar with good food and TV's all around to watch every football game playing that day. All in all, I loved this place and can't wait to go back.","date":"2012-05-20 10:07:47 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":3,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Jaquan Klein","content":"We stayed at the Intercontinental for one night pre-cruise. The Good: We got a great deal on this hotel so it was hard to pass up. The room was nice, clean and bed bug free. I even checked the mattress by removing the sheets and inspecting the seems of the mattress and there was no evidence of bed bugs. Also, the pool area was really nice, but we didn't get to use it because of the weather. The Location: The hotel is in an area where there isn't a lot of local restaurants to eat at and is a little shadey in the evening. The costs of taxis back and forth to Old San Juan ($20 each way) and to the Pan American Pier ($15 each way) really added to the cost of our stay. The Awful: As has been previously mentioned, DO NOT have breakfast in the hotel. There was a torrential downpour the morning we were there, so we decided to eat in the hotel. The cold breakfast ($17) consists of cereal, fruit and store bought mini-pastries. The larger hot breakfast ($22) includes the cheese and cold meats as well as some egg and sausage. In my experience a continental, cold buffet includes the meat and cheeses, so we were surprised when we were charged $22 each for the breakfast we had. Also the service to get coffee and juice was terrible. I never got the milk I asked for for my coffee, I ended up having to go to the buffet for it. Finally when we checked out they asked how our stay was, I said the room was fine, but that the breakfast service was terrible and all I got was a smile and \"that's good\" If you're looking for a good deal and don't plan on going to Old San Juan to eat, then this hotel would be a good option, but please go to the Mi Casita restaurant across the street for breakfast, even in the pouring rain!","date":"2015-01-18 00:21:48 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":2,"Overall":3,"Rooms":4,"Service":2,"Value":4}},{"author":"Giovanni Christiansen PhD","content":"So I read up on tons of reviews on here before going to San Juan, and here's my experience. Having never been to Puerto Rico, I was surprised at the poverty. The area around the hotel wasn't bad, but also wasn't great. The roads were torn up, traffic was horrible, and the businesses were seedy! People would pull over and park ANYWHERE - in the middle of the road, blocking an entire lane, etc. We booked our trip through CheapCaribbean and got a great deal. It said we would get a free room upgrade with our booking from a Deluxe Pool\/Garden.....and the next upgrade is Ocean View. Upon check-in, I asked for our oceanfront room and was told that the free upgrade is only for a city view room. I showed him the paper that said otherwise, and after some arguing back and forth the check-in assistant agreed and upgraded us to an oceanview room at no charge (as we were supposed to be). The room was gorgeous. Room 908 (9th floor). The view of the ocean was amazing. You could tell that the rooms were a bit older but had been upgraded. Newer paint, flatscreen TV, refrigerator, etc. Some people on here complained about a smell - everything smelled fine to me. The only thing that the room was lacking was a microwave. And yes - as others said, the refrigerators get TOO cold and sometimes freeze your food and drinks. Overall I'd give the room an 8.5 out of 10. I have heard others complain about \"bed bugs.\" We did have a lot of bites on our legs, but we also visited the rainforest and walked on the beach at night so I can't say if these bites came from the ROOM or from being outside. Either way, it wasn't a huge deal to me. I didn't see a single bug in the hotel or in our room, and everything seemed very nice and clean. As others stated, housekeeping didn't replenish towels. We called down to the lobby and they sent some up immediately. We visited the casino one night. It's nice and small and out of the way. I actually won $80 on the penny and nickel machines! Towards the back of the casino where you redeem your winnings, it looked like it needed some updating (gaps in walls, etc.) We didn't eat at the hotel - there are plenty of other places to eat for cheaper. Church's Chicken, Denny's, Burger King, etc. I'm a picky eater so it was nice to have a wide variety of food around you within walking distance. If you rent a car (we did for the entire time), beware! Ha. The drivers there are HORRID. It seemed like every other car had a burnt out tail light, and they would swerve in front of you like speed demons. It takes some getting used to. You'll see trucks pulled over int he middle of the road, and you have to go around them. The cops do NOT care what people do on the road or where they park from what it seemed. I also saw many police vehicles with their lights on....casually driving down the road. I think they turned their lights on simply to get around some of the traffic. We did use the \"business center\" at the hotel to print our boarding passes. They offer free wi-fi in the rooms, but if you need to print anything you need to use one of their computers. I was charged $5 for 10 minutes of internet usage, and $1 per page in black and white. OUTRAGEOUS! We did NOT get charged any \"resort fees,\" but you DO have to pay $16 a day for self parking. Seems expensive, but what can you do. The parking in this area is just HORRENDOUS - nowhere near enough parking. Upon checkout, everything went smoothly. We paid $55 in parking fees (Mon afternoon until Fri at 12 noon). Keep in mind that we did travel in mid-October (off season), which was GOOD. Less crowds! The weather was fantastic. The rain showers last maybe 15 minutes, and then it's back to bright sunny weather! One thing to mention - it is SO HUMID IN PUERTO RICO! Not a single breeze, just HOT AND HUMID. We were dripping sweat from walking only 15 minutes in Old San Juan. Be prepared! There are many Walgreen's on the island, but the one close to the Intercontinental is HIGH PRICED. Expect to pay double what you do at a Walgreen's in the States. We stopped at another Walgreens in Old San Juan that had much better prices. If it's close to the tourist hotels, chances are it's overpriced! For anyone else going, you MUST go to Flamenco Beach on Culebra. GORGEOUS. The best beach in the world. It's a $2.50 ferry ride from Fajardo (an hour from the Intercontinental), and $2.50 back. The snorkeling is phenomenal, and the beach is out of this world. We also saw the rainforest and Old San Juan, but Culebra was the highlight of our trip. If your goal is to see a great beach and snorkel......Culebra is for you! Overall - if you can get a good deal, it's a very nice hotel. Not perfect, but definitely not bad like some people have claimed. I paid $1100 for roundtrip flights for 2 out of Minneapolis and my free oceanfront room upgrade, including tax. That boiled down to about $100 a night for an oceanfront view, which is normally $250 a night. The Intercontinental was a great choice given the price we paid. I'd easily rate it a 9 out of 10. Not perfect, but definitely a very nice hotel. Very convenient location, and excellent pool (which is open 24 hours!) If you can get a good price, it's definitely worth staying here!","date":"2013-11-21 08:56:51 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.theliner.co.uk\/","vacancy":true}

Our room was 818 great views, very quite, fruit and water the first night, 2nd night some kind of chocolate cup cakes with cherries (holla somebody, these were so good), another night a free movie ~ wonderful. We rented a car for one day and drove to the El Yunque - beautiful, then to Luquillo Beach area to visit the kioskos. We eat at El Jefe - omg, this food is to die for, the burger with the puerto rican cheese yummy!!! Great service there also. This was just an amazing trip. Several little places to eat right across the street, however, only one bad review for this trip. We eat at Mi Casita (we read so many good things about this place and the food) the first night it was a little crowded the food was cold and the cornish hen was so dry you could not eat it, service was poor, we gave this place a second chance for breakfast- not many customers this time, but again the service was horrible, they served our coffee and the food arrived 25 minutes later no refills on the coffee, not one time asked if everything was ok, same way the night we eat there also. The staff just stood there and stared at us the entire time, a very uncomfortable feeling ~ needless to say we did not go back and will not in the future. We did a day of sailing and snorkling with East Winds these folks are awesome, we had a great time. Overall one oth the best vacations I've ever taken and would stay at the InterContinental Hotel again - the neighborhood surrounding the hotel however, does need a little cleaning up. PS...anyone staying in room 818 look in the desk drawer in the back there you will find a Puerto Rico coupon book and coupons for East Wind, with the coupon book there are several buy one get one free meals that saved us a ton of money, there was no way we could use them all and a 10% total bill for East Wind...enjoy and pass on to the next guest please.

It's only a mile and a half and a cab costs $11.00 each way. If you plan on arriving early, keep your beach\/pool wear handy. Check in is at 4:00 and they pretty much hold to it. I reserved the \"laguna view\" room which is in the front of the hotel facing a parking lot, the city and in the distance mountains and a lagoon. Floors 7 and up qualify as laguna view. It is noisy in the front. You will hear traffic and planes all day. The balconies are small and no room for chairs. The room was clean although candy wrappers were found. The furnishings were on the old side but the bed was great. There is a separate vanity area for the ladies with a magnifying mirror, vanity bench and plenty of light. There's a safe, old TV, IPOD station and free wireless internet throughout. The restaurants are expensive as well as the drinks. There are good local restaurants all within walking distance.

The halls in the club level did smell mildewy and moldy, but it's on a beach, so not totally unexpected. Pool area and beach were more than adequate. The gym had plenty of equipment although in a somewhat small space; oh, bring your headphones for the tvs on the cardio machines, they do not provide them.

Very adequate fitness center. Spa appeared to be adequate although we never used the services. The hotel even set up a large screen television and showed family movies each night -with free water and popcorn for the kids. Concierge service was very helpful with maps and driving directions and bus information etc. (tour info too - although we preferred to go it on our own - mostly). There is an Avis car rental at the hotel. We used the free wireless internet to make our auto reservation, taking advantage of discounts. Service was very good there as well. We had excellent service without exception. We had a very safe and enjoyable time! We booked at this time of year to have a relaxing vacation during a \"slow\" time. Our goal was to relax, take it easy and not try to do too much. We made no firm plans - other than the flights and hotel - but had a few activities in mind, if we felt like it. We stayed five nights beginning September 8th. The taxi ride from the airport was very short($11.50 plus $1 per bag). Check in was smooth and timely. The representative did advise us, however, that there was a apx $10 per night service fee that was not collected by \"Priceline\" that would be collected a check-out. There were no other suprises. Being \"Priority Club\" members we asked to upgrade to an ocean front view room. After declining to purchase the upgrade we were upgraded free of charge. The view was wonderful! The restaurants at the hotel are top notch, steakhouse (Ruth's Chris), Japanese (MomoYama) and Italian. There is a pool bar and a restaurant\/ bar with a large deck right on the beach. The restaurants, and \"pool drinks\" can become pricey fast. No worry, there is a small market across the street and Walgreens right down the street (either direction).

We did eat one night at the Italian place at the hotel and had great food and service. We had the best of both worlds - We mainly went to the pool and beach each day ... and enjoyed the hot-tub each night. And we had the best of both worlds here too - pool and beach! Although we did not, there were Jetski rentals available on the beach by the resort next door. Although we brought our personal snorkle gear - we did not snorkle and I got the impression that for really \"good\" snorkling we would need to go elsewhere. Nevertheless, a great beach and water right outside your door! We did go to Old San Juan one half day. You can rent a car, take the city bus (easy and safe - just don't go late) or pay for a cab. We rented a car one day as well and drove to the National Park\/ rainforest . (about 45 minutes drive - tops - use the toll road!) The conceirge and all the staff were very helpful with questions to help plan with these activities. Check-out was uneventful and prompt as well as the taxi to the airport.

It was a quick flight for both of us and we knew we wanted to stay somewhere fun and yet romantic at the same time. We choose to stay in Isla Verde and Im glad we did. All the beaches in P.R. are public and this particular beach, is lined with a strip of hotels. Upon arrival to intercontinental we were greeted by HELPFUL, sweet and really nice bell hops and service guys. We arrived early before check in which is 4 pm. They took our bags, allowed us to check in, and use their facilities while we waited for our room to get ready. We strolled the hotel, which is beautiful. It has an amazing pool and jacuzzi, a spa, 24 gym, and the beach is right in the backyard. There are many restaurants to eat at. Now at Intercontinental, im sure you can book the cheapest room and have the same experience. We purchased a laguna room and we face the front of the city towards san juan. You can see the city lights and sky at night from our balcony. This time of year seems to be tropical rainy season, which we had for the first 2-3 days but it doesnt last long, usually at night, and even if it kinda ruin your plans for the day, your room and the hotel is a great place to stay. We didnt eat much here at the hotel because we know it is expensive, but this ave is a strip full of hotels and shopping area. Right across the street there is a little center. There is ponderosa food (which is kinda like a buffet salad bar, finger food type place), lins chinese which is excellent, and this puerto rican home cooked style place called Mi Casita, which my bf and I particular loved, the food is great and the price is reaaaallllyyy cheap. We had breakfast 1 morning, and it was only $12 for the both of us, they give you really good food and the right portion. They are open from 7am-10pm, most places here close @ 11pm so make sure you eat according to time. There is also wendy's, burger king, a little supermarket, a walgreens a few blocks down, (make a right when you exit the hotel in front entrance). For night life, we went from hotel to hotel. Intercontinental is classy and sophisticated, but if you need a dj, bar, lounges and music, head to El San Juan Hotel, which is left from intercontinental. They have a huge hotel lobby which is fun and exciting, the dj plays music and there is also a house band for a more local experience. There is also lounges and alot of bars, dress to impress at these places. To the right of intercontinental, at the water club approx 2-3 blocks down, then a sharp right.. there is a restaurant called Tangerine\/ Liquid. And a roof top sushi bar on the 17th foor, open roof that overlooks the ocean. Prices are ok. There is also local shops, bars, grills and other places on this avenue. For a Local experience, head to old san juan. We took the bus, it was just like a NYC bus. 0.75 cents to the last stop takes you to the bus terminal downtown. Be prepared to walk. We walked the tourist area where the cruise ships dock and also made our way to the historic sites, by the forts which was $3.00 per person to enter, definitely worth it because it was fun and you get a great view of San Juan. El Yunque Rainforest is a must. There is a half day trip from 9:30am-3pm. Its $57.00 a person through the hotel. The tour guide picks you up, gives you a tour while driving, a cave trip, history of P.R., rainforest info, and waterfall treats. This rainforest is about a 1.5 hr trip. Alot of walking, defintiely a cardiovascular workout, uphill and downhill through the forest, very beautiful and romantic .. a must see.. we stopped for lunch at a local place right by the rainforest for what i thought was some of the best P.R. food ever, definitely try the beans and rice with fried chicken and sweet plaintains, ($1.00 items -$6.00) other packages include 3 trips, the rainforest, beach and a nite rafting trip, supposedly the water illuminates in the nite while you boat near the forest. Food on the Hotel: we ate by the beach, at Splash , mostly wraps, finger foods, salads.. good food. drinks and food from $12. other than that, we didnt do much, the casino is not as big as some other hotels but if you dont like to gamble much like me, its ok. You can hotel hop, and no one I.D.'s you , you can enjoy the facilities everywhere. overall this was a great experience and i hope if others are like me, i hope this helped. I thought the service was great, the customer service was excellent, we never had a problem and if we did they were more than happy to help us, very friendly and CLEAN.. our rooms were cleaned everyday with new towels and linens. coffee maker, ice bucket, fridge, safe, iron, alarm clock (ipod home) and cable t.v. in room. official website and pics are accurate.. a beautiful experience!! and complimentary wireless internet from every room which i am submitting this review since we are leaving tomorrow :) we didnt rent a car but if you feel you need too, the hotel has an avis hook up in the lobby where you can get , if you need to or change your mind 24hr rental for about $40 .","date":"2013-07-14 13:04:32 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":4,"Overall":5,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.novotel.com\/gb\/hotel-6495-novotel-liverpool-centre\/index.shtml","vacancy":false}

I chose the Intercontinental over several hotels in the same area, and we are so glad we did! We were upgraded to an ocean view room upon arrival. The ocean view is SPECTACULAR! You can see the neat, tropical pool area too. We were offered early check-in, pretty much as soon as we arrived from the airport. The room was the perfect size for a couple, chicly decorated, and although they did miss a day or two of cleaning it, housekeeping responded promptly to all of our requests. Pluses: Beautiful hotel, very clean, wonderful service from bell boys to housekeeping to concierge, several on-site restaurants and bars, great TVs in rooms, near a couple cute places like Lupis down the street, and fun\/large pool area Minuses: Sub-par food at all the restaurants including room service food, WAY OVERPRICED food and drink (just don't plan to eat and drink within the hotel unless you like $15 made-from-frozen hamburgers and $10 vodka-cranberries), not the most glamorous or convenient location (cost us $22 minimum to take a cab anywhere we wanted to go - there just isn't much to do in this part of San Juan) Overall we had a romantic, lovely time, felt like we got a relatively good deal (paid $2300 total for the two of us for 4 nights\/5 days - included airfare, hotel, food\/drink while there, cab rides, and a kayaking trip), and would return!","date":"2014-10-15 07:01:29 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":1,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":3,"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Bobbie Wehner","content":"I enjoyed my stay at the hotel. The pool very nice and the beach was ok. The tide was a little ruff. The cafe was small but the food was excellent. Fair prices considering your at a resort. The waitresses and waiters was all friendly and courteous. The Pina Colada's were excellent.......Waleska made the best. The hotel was a little to quite for me and the casino was small and had out dated slot machines. We stayed in a suite which was nice and clean, but small compared to many suites I have seen. There was no tub, which in my opinion is not a suite. All the suites only had a city view with a very small balcony not big enogh for a small table or chair. And with having a city view suite there is not much privacy because you are on the front entrance side of the hotel and there is alot of traffic in and out of the hotel. There are plenty of places outside the resort to get food at a great price. Not sure of the exact name but I believe it's called Misa Casa ( great food \/great price) which is in th shopping center across the street from resort. There is also a nice small sushi bar about a block up the street that served excellent sushi and the miso soup was to die for. I visited a few other hotels in the immediate area and found the El San Juan was the place to be to hang out on the weekends.

We got a room on the 5th floor facing the pool and it was great. We were not too concerned about the room location since we were not planning on staying in the room all day. We arrived at the hotel around 1:30pm and were checked in right away even though check-in is usually at 4pm. The bell boy brought up the bags promptly and we were off to the beach and pool almost immediately. The pool and beach is excellent at this hotel. You have to get a wrist band in order to get towels & pillows and it also identifies you as a guest of the hotel when on the beach. The pool area has tents with chairs that can be reserved a day earlier or taken on a first come first serve basis. All the hotel staff was very courteous and helpful throughout our stay and we had no complaints at all. The concierge at the hotel was very helpful in providing us with directions and recommendations during our stay there. The restaurants on site were expensive and so was room service. Prior to visiting Puerto Rico my wife and I decided to only consume local cuisine so we didnâ€™t ever eat at the hotel. The hotel itself has a Steak House, an Italian Restaurant & a Japanese Restaurant. The pool side bar and the beach front cafe were also pretty expensive. Please note that the beach front cafe is cheaper than the pool side bar even though they are only a few feet away from each other. I basically went to the small supermarket directly in front of the hotel and grabbed some Medalla Light (local) beer and brought it to the room and put it in the fridge. I then took it down to the pool and beach in a plastic cup. The same beer 10oz costs $4 at the hotel while the super market sells it for $1.25. The security at the hotel was very good and the pool and beach guard (Mike) is very friendly. We rented a car for our stay from Alamo and I chose to use the self parking option. Since parking is scarce in the area, all hotels charge for parking. At the InterContinental they charge $16 for self parking and $22 for valet. The self parking lot is across the street from the hotel but itâ€™s not a problem at all to use. Some people have mentioned concern about crossing the street. We live in the NJ\/NY area and crossing the streets in our areas is pretty similar so it wasnâ€™t a big deal for us. If you want to have some local fare walk over to Mi Casita directly in front of the hotel. Itâ€™s a small place with a small menu but the food is excellent. Another restaurant in walking distance is Metropol. They have Puerto Rican and Cuban food and is excellent as well. We went to Metropol twice during our stay. We went to Old San Juan a few times (for meals and sightseeing). It was convenient to have a car. I used my blackberry and Google maps (gps) to help me with the directions. All road signs are in Spanish so a GPS will really help. Some restaurants that we tried in Old San Juan are, Tantra (Indo-Latino fusion), Dragonfly (Latino-Asian Fusion) and Cafeteria Mallorca (located on Calle San Francisco in Old San Juan) typical local restaurant - they have some really good rice dishes and a chicken soup that local crave for. Another must visit restaurant is Ajili Mojili (1006, Ashford Avenue San Juan, PR 00907 Puerto Rico). Itâ€™s located in Condado (between Isle Verde and Old San Juan). They have the best Mofongo and Asapao (local delicacies). Day trips we did: El Yunque Rain Forest - I even took a dip under the water fall after the 30 min hike. ATV tours at Hacienda Carabali - Ask the concierge for the directions to this place. We did the 2 hour ATV tour and it was awesome. They even stopped at a river and we were able to jump in. They are located between the El Yunque Rain Forest and Luquillo Beach. Luquillo Beach - One of the best beaches in PR. Itâ€™s located a miles past the road to the El Yunque Rain Forest towards Fajardo. Try out some local food at the Luquillo Beach food kiosks. If you are going to the above mentioned 3 places I recommend that you take the 187 road. This is the most scenic way towards Fajardo. You will also pass some unique local kiosks with food and drinks (try some coco - coconut water). Old San Juan - Takes about a full day to view the whole town and all the fortresses, etc. We will definitely go back to PR and stay at the InterContinental San Juan Resort, Spa & Casino.

I had the task of researching for a place to hold my company's convention. I found the Intercontinental. I was flown down there, all expenses paid, for 3 nights to take a look at the property. I then also stayed there for another 3 nights during our convention. I was there on business for the first trip so I was treated like royalty. Meals prepared from the Head Chef, one of their nicer rooms, a private dinner on the beach along the boardwalk, complimentary trips off the property, meeting with management etc... Everyone there was beyond nice and professional. Now I know this is not the treatment most people will get, but it is certainly a reflection on how they treat their customers and the pride that they take in their property. Top notch employees all around. My room on this trip was in the \"club\" house. It overlooked the pool area (which was still a good view cause the pool is awesome). The room was great. The marbled bathroom, the large fluffy bed, the sitting area, the deck. This area also has a private dining space for the club members. Breakfast is served here as well as appetizers from 5pm-7pm. My second stay was more normal with no special treatment. My room was a regular room in the hotel. I did get beach views, which was gorgeous. The room itself is your standard hotel room. It is very clean however. The property is amazing. It sits right on the beach. The beach is public, but they do have people that make sure not just anybody wanders onto the property. The pool area is great too. Palm trees, and a swim up bar, another regular bar, a huge hot tub. There is a \"rock wall\" type thing in the pool with a waterfall coming down. It definately sets that tropical feel and makes your stay all the more relaxing. The staff for the pool area are also awesome and extremely nice. The steps out of the hotel leading to the pool are a grand staircase that makes you feel like you are Scarlet O'Hara at the beach making your grand entrance. I am not much for gambling and didn't spend tons of time in the casino. I can't really compare it to any other casino cause I have never really been! But it had slot machines, black jack, poker tables etc... and all the bright, flashing lights you would expect. The whole hotel is very nice. Marble everywhere. It just has presence. There are several hotels on the property including a Ruth Chris, an Italian restaurant that just opened when I was there. It was a top notch high end restaurant. We met the Chef as her personally came out to our table. A great meal. One of the best I have ever had. The also have a Japanese restaurant on the premise. All of them are pretty expensive, but the food reflects that price. If your company is planning a convention or retreat I would highly recommend this location. I would also recommend it for your next PR vacation.","date":"2012-11-13 21:38:39 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Carlos Price PhD","content":"overall a great hotel. the location was great, physical property is in good shape and the staff was great. the beach was nice and pool area equally good. its a solid 4 star hotel that we would not only reccommend, but stay at again for sure.","date":"2012-01-02 17:49:06 +0300","ratings":{"Overall":4}},{"author":"Abigail Keeling","content":"My stay at the Intercontinental Hotel San Juan was for 2 nights on September 14, 2007, for a pre-cruise stay. I arrrived into San Juan in the late afternoon, took the fixed rate taxi to the hotel, and was greeted warmly by the bell staff as they did each and every time I entered or departed the hotel. I was effeciently and pleasantly checked into my room #1123 by the front desk clerk. This very nice service is what I had remembered from a previous stay at another San Juan hotel, but, unfortunately this is where the friendly service ended at the Intercontinental San Juan. My room, although small, was cheerfully decorated and the bed was fluffy and comfortable with the bottom sheet completely covering the matress. The small balcony overlooked the street area and airport landing traffic (no problem with noise). I immediately noticed that the room contained nice bathroom amenities and plenty of towels, but, none of the usual Room Service Menu\/Service Directory\/Writing Paper portfolio. The room also had an ironing board but no iron. In calling for these items, I was told that the iron would be sent up but I would have to call the Business Center for the portfolio. Okay fine. Business Center says call Housekeeping, each time being asked, \"Anything else I can do for you?\" To me, this is the most frustrating situation with Customer Service. If you haven't been able to fullfill my request, don't ask if you can do anything else. I decided it was not that important to get the portfolio. As it turned out the iron was broken, but, was replaced quickly the next day. After a very long trip, I went to bed early but was awakened by loud voices in the hallway, mistaken phone calls and knocking at the door. After falling asleep again, I was awakened again by the 3 false fire alarms mentioned by a previous review. The next night did go much better with no alarms! My room was made up the second day very promptly after leaving for lunch and the Housekeeping department was quiet and unobtrusive. As mentioned in previous reviews,the beach at the Intercontinental is very nice and the hotel has great service for guests who wish to be served while in the sun. The pool is also very nice and security is tight, making it difficult for anyone who is not a regestered guess to be admitted. The gym is well-equipped, adequately air conditioned,and has a nice view of the beach, and is open 24-hours. The ice machine on my floor worked well and always had plenty of ice. As I stay in hotels about 12 nights a month, I have to say that the young lady at check out gets the award for the worst in the world. She was curt, rude, and did not even offer to show me a list of my charges prior to charging my card. She had no change in cash to accommodate my request for small bills acting as if this was a strange request for a hotel cashier. No thank you's or offers of assistance with bags from her. All of this after waiting 5 minutes for other clerk on duty to finish her personal conversation with a co-worker. All in all, this hotel is quite a blast from the past. I fully expected to see Lucy, Ethel, Fred and Ricky pass through the lobby while on their \"Puerto Rican Adventure.\" Truely a place where my Mom and Dad would have spent their honeymoon. Not a bad thing if staff could be brought up-to-date on current standards of service in the hotel industry.","date":"2013-10-04 08:29:27 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":2,"Check in \/ front desk":1,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":4,"Overall":2,"Rooms":4,"Service":2,"Value":3}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.radissonblu.co.uk\/hotel-liverpool","vacancy":true}

Across the street is Wendy's, Pizza Hut and a bakery, which is good for a cheap breakfast but be prepared to wait a long time for your bagel - they are very slow. Also check out the Palm restaurant at the El San Juan. The only drawback is if you are into the outdoorsy kind of activities, stay in Fajardo instead.

A lot of work, actually. It's obvious they are trying to do just that, but in the meantime, the rooms are very, very outdated. The furnishings and amenities are way behind what we've come to expect in a hotel at $400\/night. The doors, trim, air conditioning vents, balcony railing and plumbing fixtures are all in really awful, outdated condition. They should have been updated 10 years ago -- they are *well* beyond their prime. If you are accustomed to seeing flat panel TV's, contemporary furniture and duvets on the beds, this is definitely not the hotel for you. On the plus side, the beds are comfortable, the rooms are spacious and nicely arranged (other than the bathroom, which is the smallest hotel bathroom I've seen in years.) The beach access is fantastic and the beach itself is very nice. The view from the oceanview rooms is not going to be beat. There are a few restaurants (ie: other hotel restaurants) within walking distance, which is a nice plus, and the restaurants in the hotel (with the exception of the downstairs breakfast restaurant) are nice. The worst part of this hotel is that they had our email address since the day I made the reservation several months ago and we were never notified about the pool renovations. That is really an unacceptable oversight. (And I am probably being generous in calling this an 'oversight.') I cannot even begin to imagine the disappointment this would have created had my stay there been a family vacation! Until the pool is complete, I would be not recommend this hotel, unless you do not mind staying in an outdated room at a resort with no pool. Even when the pool is complete, I would personally not stay here again unless the entire hotel were fully renovated.

Growing up my family had an apartment in the ESJ towers and I have been to San Juan several times. We have also been to other parts of the Caribbean, Mexico, Europe, etc., and I cannot really complain about this hotel. We stayed on the 15th floor with an ocean view. (Definitely worth it) The rooms were very nice and we did not hear any noise at all. The staff was very friendly and though we only ate lunch at the restaurant by the pool it was very good, yes it was expensive but you are paying for the convenience of sitting in your bathing suit and not having to leave the grounds. The only complaint I have and it wasn't even that bad was the pool could have been cleaner. I am not talking about leaves, etc., but the actual pool walls seemed dirty and it made the pool look murky. Not a big deal though. We had drinks and walked around El San Juan next door. Really fun on Saturday night. The lobby is beautiful, you could make a whole night out of relaxing by the bar and people watching. They have a live band and everyone dances. The prices are actually cheaper there than at the lobby bar at the IC. ($16 for a shot of Patrone) Starting that Friday there was a culinary food festival going on in Old San Juan. Perfect for us foodies! Instead of just going to one restaurant we got a chance to sample a few. They had tables set up all along Calle Fortalezza and several live bands. We had an appetizer of blackened seared tuna in a Thai peanut sauce at Tantra that was out of this world. We also ate at Dragonfly, Aquaviva, and the Parrot Club. The halibut at the Parrot club was excellent. We had planned and usually do go to more traditional restaurants while on vacation but ended up at these places and I am not complaining. It started off the first night when we ended up strolling into the water club near the IC and ate at Tangerine, One cevicehe appetizer later and we were hooked to the modern\/fusion restaurants. We did go down the street from the IC to the Metropol for the black bean soup, it was yummy, just as I remembered. One more thing, the IC does hit you with a hefty occupancy tax\/resort service charge, (about $66 a day on weekdays, $80 on weekends) I believe they tell you that when you actually book the room, I suppose I overlooked it and was a bit shocked upon checking out. Regardless, I would stay at the IC again.

We had a decent sized room (king bed, sofa) facing the ocean. It does make a big difference when you get that view and open your sliding door for a nice breeze off the ocean. The higher your floor the better the view. People have complained about the walls being very thin and hearing everybody else but honestly it depends who is staying next to you. It's pretty much luck of the draw. Tell the front desk if your neighbors are too loud. They'll handle it for you. The hotel is very very close to the airport so that's good but also bad in some respects. Only an $11 cab ride (5 min) away but you can hear the boom of the planes arriving and departing close by. Bewteen 11 pm and 7 am the airport has very minimal activity. The pool area is very spacious with plenty of comfy chairs to claim. The staff is very attentive and accommodating to help you enjoy your stay there. There are two bars\/restaurants at the pool area, one closer to the beach and one has a swim up bar. The \"Splash\" swim up bar makes their drinks better than the Ciao restaurant. Definitely important when your paying $8 per drink plus tipping. Food at both places is your typical bar food. Pricier because of the convenience of eating right there at the poolside\/beachsisde. You can walk right across the street to a few places for cheaper breakfast\/lunch food (i.e. Subway). The beach outside the hotel is decent but the ocean water surprisingly has lots of seaweed. They have water activities such as jet skiing, parasailing, banana boat. Isla Verde beach area allows you to take nice walks up and down the coast. The hotel offers you chairs and umbrellas for the beach as a guest, free of charge, just throw a few $ tip to the guys busting their butts hauling them out for you. They have a decent gym overlooking the ocean close to the beach. It's included in your stay. The hotel has a few different restaurants- sushi, steak, italian, breakfast buffet. Did all of them except for the italian. Enjoyed all of them, little pricier but that's expected for hotel standards. The casino is pretty good, open every day from 10am-4am. Guy sells cigars in front of it during the evening. Little bar in the lobby area with salsa playing music in the evenings. If you plan on hanging in the lobby area during the evening bring a sweatshirt, it's cold in there! People actually hang out in there because it's nice. The concierge desk was very helpful to us in planning dinners and various other activities. Highly recommend Nestor or Joselle. All in all it was a very nice place and the weather in PR was great, obviously the reason people go to the island for vacationing. Would stay there again if we visited PR again. El San Juan hotel next door is pretty sweet with a cool lobby\/ bar area but it's also much more expensive.","date":"2013-10-29 00:52:24 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Value":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.hotelindigoliverpool.co.uk\/","vacancy":false}

Our second night in San Juan was my wife's birthday and they suggested Aguaviva and took care of the details for us, the restaurant was excellent. They assisted several times with directions and getting our boarding passes when the hotel's internet service was down. Five starts for concierge's. Dinner at the restaurant was very good and priced competitively. The hotel is close to everything in Old San Juan. We only had two minor issues, one was internet service, it was not available for most of the stay and had to have our boarding passes faxed to the hotel after using a cell phone to check in, which to say the least was painful. The second was breakfast. The buffet offered did not live up to the $20.00 per person. Our breakfast there was $50.00 with the tip and tax while a short walk to local eateries was one-fifth the price and just as good.","date":"2015-12-05 01:25:13 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Ryley Koelpin","content":"We stayed for 8 nights.

You will save significant amounts. Other people have complained about the mold. The stairs area near the pool was bad. Our room on the 8th floor was fine.

We got a good price at the Sheraton on Priceline. I was a little unsure of the location due to the proximity to the cruise ships. and the possibility of being overrun by passengers every time we stepped out the door. It never was a problem. In fact I enjoyed looking out and seeing which ship was in every day. I found the location so central to all of old San Juan that I'd choose it again for just that reason. Every staff person we came in contact with was friendly and helpful. We had a standard room, and it was fine. It isn't shiny new, and the furniture was dark old wood of the West Indies style. I liked it all. The beds were very comfy and house keeping did a good job of cleaning and fulfilling any requests we had. In the room, I never heard other guests except the ones in the halls who appeared to be returning from late night partying. It feels like on weekends all of the island comes to town, so there is probably noise everywhere. My suggestion would be to join them and walk around the old town as late as you want. Around the hotel feels very safe, as does all the town within the confines of the tourist areas. The gym was adequate. It was nice to look out over the sea from the treadmills. The pool is small, as others have reported. Not having gone on vacation to swim, I didn't mind. I felt I could have done some laps had I been inclined to -just short ones.The few times we went up to sit by the pool there were chairs open, and it was peaceful. I imagine if a large family came in it would feel a bit crowded. I do like a bit of slot playing, but it didn't take more than one night to find I wasn't going to be lucky in the casino. It's small, and has less choices than I'm accustomed to. Maybe give it an evening if you like. The locals go there and are fun to chat with. I learned from them that while playing the machines, you can order not only free drinks, but free sandwiches as well. They were having some sort of ham and cheese cooked things that might make a nice snack for the price of a tip. If you aren't driving, skip this part...We rented a car to get out and see more of the island. To avoid the $21.40\/nt valet parking, we parked on the street. Coming back in the day time, there was usually a spot within a block of the hotel. You have to look closely, because it's illegal to park where the curb has yellow or blue paint. You will see many people park there anyway, and I don't know how many tickets were written. At night, there are various fellows who stand on the curbs and direct people into parking spaces. They will guide you in as if they are teaching you to parallel park for the first time, then they stand near waiting for a dollar or two tip. We questioned one man after we parked and realized the curb was yellow. He assured us the police didn't give tickets at night for parking there. We moved the car shortly anyway, and soon saw a ticket being written to someone else nearby, so - do it at your own risk. On the weekend, the city seems to fill up and make street parking at less available. We ended up valet parking Friday and Saturday night. There are 2 or 3 parking garages near the hotel. Short term, they seem like a decent price, but it's unclear about the pricing for 24 hr parking.Check before you enter and have to pay to leave if you change your mind. We didn't find a garage that was less than the valet for our needs. We did do some driving in and around town. I wouldn't have had the patience for it had i been on my own, but my friend drives regularly in London and found it manageable. If you can't decide about getting a car, you can walk all over old town and just rent when you want to get out of town. The major touristy sites out of SJ also have tours to take you if you don't want to drive.There's a Hertz office in the Sheraton. We took a taxi to Coronado one evening so we could drink, and it was $12 one way and $15 back. Taxi to airport from the hotel was $21. If you are going to the Sheraton pre-cruise, do your research and see where your ship docks. You may be able to just cross the street and board, but if it's farther down the docks, you may choose a short taxi ride. As for the restaurants in the hotel, there were so many others we wanted to try, we didn't eat there except for a quick burger. It was just that - a burger. Nothing more. I recommend getting up and walking the city early while it's cool, or near sunset. There is so much to see and if you get lost, just head downhill toward the docks and you'll find the Sheraton. No matter where you choose to stay, do get out and soak in the charm and color of old San Juan.","date":"2015-09-16 01:32:34 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.theroyalvictoria.co.uk\/","vacancy":true}

It is across the street from San Juan bay. A short walk takes one into the heart of old San Juan and all the cafÃ©s, restaurants, night spots, small museums and historic spots. The problems with this hotel are mostly due to historic reasons. The fact that the building in which its housed goes back to a different area and wasn't meant as a hotel means that it has no parking of its own. There is, however, a municipal parking across the street at the side of the building, and another a block away. Rates are quite reasonable (Don't use the hotel's valet parking. They use the very same municipal parking, but charge four times as much!). Also because of cramped space, amenities are on the smallish size, but quite adequate. For example, the pool is on the roof and not large, meant to dip in, not swim. On the other hand, they've made it pleasant. On the bright side, they've used their imagination to squeeze in as many amenities as possible in the cramped space. Thus, in addition to the pool, the hotel has a comparatively large fitness room, a restaurant, conference rooms, a bar-and-burger joint and, of course, the casino. The decor is simple, but nice. Very simple, the color schemes being bright pastels (Y'know, the whole tropical thing). Room furniture is on the theme of the austere, dark Spanish colonial look, simple but quite adequate. I personally liked it. The room is comfortably sized. Air conditioned worked fine (A blessing in the tropics), the bathroom larger than in most hotels and well appointed. The whole of the hotel was kept very clean. Tickets were given to me when I checked in for a full buffet breakfast free, with waffles and omelettes cooked to order. There were enough for me and my daughter to cover every morning of our stay. The food was good, the service personnel very pleasant. Rates were reasonable, particularly so for Puerto Rico and especially considering the hotel's location. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, and would definitely return.","date":"2015-02-19 07:48:27 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.adcotehouse.co.uk","vacancy":false}

It felt cheap. Uninspired decor left me less than impressed. There was also a very strange smell in the room, like shower curtain that has remained wet for days and never dried kind of smell. A muggy, mildewey smell is the best way to describe it. The front desk staff was ok. I didn't find them to go above and beyond the call of duty to make me feel welcome. I also felt like they were under staffed at front desk and not very knowledgeable of procedure. My checkout lasted almost 30 mins due to some printing issue. Room service gal was awesome.

The best things about this hotel is its location in Old San Juan and the staff. You can walk everywhere in Old San Juan easily and the hotel is right on the bay so some rooms have nice bay views and the patios of the restaurants have great ocean views of all the cruise ships coming and going. The staff overall was wonderful, friendly and very helpful-especially JANMARILY at the front desk and ALEX and LUIS who worked in both restaurants. The housekeeping staff was wonderful as well and if you put the sign on your door that you weren't interested in service, they actually respected that and did not come in. Often I would pass them in the hall and they would offer extra towels or see if there was anything we needed. Top notch housekeeping and I felt very comfortable that my things were safe in the room (unlike other places I have stayed in Puerto Rico). Negatives were there is no real hotel room service, only from the restaurants which are at the hotel, one being a burger place (mediocre at best) and one a more expensive Italian restaurant. The room service food available during the day is very limited and they stop at 11pm at night. Both restaurants are also pretty slow so don't go if you are starving. However the happy hour offered at the Italian restuarant, Il Palacio I think it was called, is great-VERY affordable drinks and appetizers. My other complaints were the water in the shower never held its temperature- it would go back and forth between hot and cold during every shower (and we stayed in 3 different rooms) and also half the equipment in the gym was broken or needed maintenance. These aren't the worst things to find in a hotel so overall I am giving them a good rating.","date":"2012-10-20 14:08:34 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":3}},{"author":"Teagan Effertz Sr.","content":"We stayed here 2 days prior to a business trip to St Croix and two days after the trip.

We used it as a base to explore and drive around the whole island during the day, then we could park the car and walk all over Old San Juan exploring some really amazing restaurants, bars and shops. It would also be the perfect location pre or post cruise. That said, I wouldn't consider it anything more than basically a place to sleep. Our room was on a higher floor overlooking the docks where the cruise ships come in which was scenic but the room itself is plain but serves it's purpose. The hotel is older so the elevators are small, there's only 2 and they are slow. Be prepared for hordes of pre and post cruisers checking in with tons of luggage into the really small lobby, but considering the amount of turn over and 1 night stays this hotel has, I think they do a pretty good job. We checked out the casino which is small but ok for trying out a couple of slot machines. The only other thing is the hotel is impossible to find if you're not familiar with the area. It took us over an hour to get to the hotel from the airport when it should have taken about 15 minutes (granted it was at night). All the directions you get ahead of time seem easy enough but the words on the directions don't match the freeway signs and when you actually get into Old San Juan there's alot of one way streets that get confusing.

We reserved the room through Hotwire for about $125 a night. The best thing about this hotel is its location. It is only a couple of blocks from the pier that our shipped docked at, so we were able to walk our backs from the hotel directly to the ship at boarding time (saving an extra taxi fee). Pros: Great beds â€“ very comfortable and large. Good air conditioning in our room. Very close to the free trolley pickup (which can take you around Old San Juan). Close to some of the better restaurants. Close to Senor Frogâ€™s and a CVS drugstore. Has hard-wired internet service. Hertz rental car facility in main lobby. Cons: A little noisy at night (depending on your room location). No continental breakfast. Casino is pretty small but takes up a good bit of the lobby floor space. Brumbaugh Street (in front of hotel) is completely congested with traffic at rush hour and cruise docking times. It can take 20 minutes for a car to travel 200 ft. at these times (including the free trolley). Not much parking space. If you have a car, I recommend using the parking garage across the street â€“ much cheaper than the valet service. When we arrived, the reception desk was very friendly & helpful. We arrived at a slow time, but I assume that if you were to check-in at the busy time (when the ship is boarding\/docking), the friendliness would be replaced with more of a hurry-up attitude. They were very busy on Sunday morning between 10:30 â€“ 1:00. We had called the hotel in advance and asked them if we could check-in early (normal check-in is 3:00). They noted this and allowed us to check-in around 12:30 when we arrived. The entrance to the hotel is on the side of the building. Check-out is 11:00, but the official boarding time for the ship was ~ 2:30. The bellhops will watch your luggage from 11:00 to whenever you want to board (suggested tip 5-7$) which gives you some extra time to see Old San Juan before you have to board. Hotel has a nice sized exercise room and pool on the top floor. You can see a lot of the harbor and city from the top floor lookout. Although the hotel was nice, it was barely worth the above mentioned Hotwire price ($125 and no continental breakfast???). I certainly would not pay the $200 normal price. If you are taking the Carnival Victory on a southern Caribbean Cruise, this hotel is a good location for you.

We paid $200 for two nights on Priceline, and upgraded to a suite for an extra $50 per night when we got there. Glad we did. The suite was enormous with a balcony view of the waterfront. I peeked at some of the regular rooms which appeared small, so my room rating is based upon the suite only. There is a great burger joint (Chicago Burger?) at the base of the hotel. We also had breakfast one morning in the hotel restaurant. It was pricey at $18 pp, but was good food. The pool has a pretty neat view on the top floor of the hotel, but it is small. Service was not the best - they failed to restock the in room coffee after the first night, and we didn't have any clean towels for the second day. I would recommend this hotel still for those that are staying here for a short duration, since it is central to Old San Juan, it was walking distance from the cruise ship pier, and the majority of our time was spent exploring the area and forts on foot. This is NOT a vacation destination by itself.","date":"2013-10-30 02:34:45 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":5,"Overall":3,"Rooms":4,"Service":1,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Mrs. Valentin Williamson","content":"Very convient a small walk from the port don't even have to take a taxi!

I stayed here about 5 years or so ago when it was a Wyndham, and the property has definitely been upgraded in terms of amenities, decor, and quality\/comfort of furnishings. Although it was a suite, the single sink was inside the bathroom. It would have been tough for a family. The hotel is in a good location for those wishing to spend a day or two visiting old San Juan on their way to either other islands or to other parts of the island (we were pre-cruise). It's near the entrance, so the traffic isn't too horrible coming in. Some other old San Juan hotels (such as El Convento) are a bit of a nightmare to get into by car or taxi. Basically, all of old San Juan is walkable, and there are plenty of good eating places nearby. Notwithstanding one of the member pictures on this site, our cruise ship was docked a couple of miles away, by the executive airport. Our room was across from a nightclub, so I was worried it would be noisy, but it wasn't (on a Friday night). The living room of the suite was next to the ice machine, which was quite noisy, but the noise didn't carry into the bedroom. The TV's are flat-screen but not high-definition. The casino is nice and friendly, but has no craps table (one has to go to the Marriott in the Condado neighborhood for that). The pool is fairly small, but with a view--and probably the best for Old San Juan. My main complaint relates to the elevators. There are only two and they are small. They were jammed-packed and we couldn't get in them in the morning when we were checking out. We were finally able to squeeze into an elevator going up, then had to go up and down the hotel, to the glares of frustrated guests. This hotel is probably a good choice for someone who wants to spend a day exploring old San Juan prior to a cruise or to a trip elsewhere in Puerto Rico or the Caribbean. It's not a place to soak in the sun, lie by the beach (not near a beach), nor lie by the pool. And I wish they'd do something about the elevator situation.","date":"2012-02-11 11:20:48 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.holidaycottagewales.com\/stangwrach-cottage.htm","vacancy":false}

There were only a few people ahead of us in line, but I believe we arrived after the crowd. Our luggage was sent up to our room in the next elevator after us. We stayed one night prior to a Carnival cruise and chose this hotel only because we could walk our bags across to the port. You are only able to walk to the Carnival port, if I was taking another cruise line, I would stay elsewhere and cab it. The staff was friendly and as accomidating as they could be. Rooms were clean and ours didn't have a view, but than again we didn't pay for one. I feel they do upgrade you and are nicer when they are less crowded. It seems at times they don't have enough staff working to accomidate the crowds and a lot of tension comes from that. Also, they only have 2 elevators so it takes a lot of time to get to and from your room and we happened to be on the 9th floor, so taking the stars each time was not always an option. We had them hold our bags after we checked out and it did take about 30 minutes for them to bring them to us. The hotel was a mad house sunday from about 1030A and it still was when we left at 1230p.

We arrived mid-day on a Friday. Check in was a little disorganized due to simultaneous, convoluted problems with two group check-ins. However, our king suite was exactly as billed and our Starwood points were properly credited. We were on the 4th floor and had a great view of the bay and any cruise ships that came in. I would note that the balconies that come with the rooms are tiny. One or two people can stand outside the doors; otherwise you need to leave doors open if you want to have a chair in the balcony area. Our suite was spacious and very clean, with the usual Sheraton bed and amenities. We set out to hit the town right away, and discovered the biggest drawback of the hotel - - the elevators. The one on the right only worked intermittently, and they both were pretty slow. We tried to use the stairs with mixed results. One stairway led us to the street; another required us to exit through the restaurant's kitchen. The Sheraton's location can't be beat. We were a half block from Senior Frog's. Given the strength of the drinks there, that is the maximum you should try to walk afterwards. P.S., while Senor Frog's makes a lot of of drinks with a specific purpose in mind (incapacitating the customers), I got a great 1800\/Grand Marnier tequila there, and thoroughly enjoyed the antics. A lot of locals go there, and I noticed most of them wisely stick to beer. Some of the best restaurants, Parrot Club, Aquaviva, and Dragonfly, are only a couple of blocks away, and we walked virtually everywhere in Old San Juan, including the El Morrow Fort. There is also a nice brew pub\/steak house (Old Harbor) that is only a few blocks away. Cafe El Bombenara was an amazing old school place, with fantastic cafe con leche and great malloracs. We stayed here three days and I can't imagine a better place to stay to explore this area. There are also taxis aplenty, so commuting to other areas is easy as well. I enjoyed the Sheraton's Casino a lot. The drinks are free and they have abundant and vibrant live entertainment at night. Also, there are a lot of locals who come here and the scene is great. I just played slots and found them to be pretty fair. The pool is small, but it's located on the roof and has great views. It is a fun area during the day, and you pick up on the excitement of people waiting to go on cruises and get advice from those who just came back. Our favorite nightspot was the Parrot Club, which had the best drinks in town (we put this matter to the test). The signature Parrot Punch was very good, but the mojitos were beyond compare. Our bartender, Anthony, could well be dubbed the Ambassador for Puerto Rico. My wife and I have never met a friendlier person in all our travels, and he made fantastic drinks and guided us through the menu with aplomb. His insights on both the area and country were much appreciated. We loved the food at Aquaviva. This is a great seafood place with an intimate atmosphere and good vibe. Check out was a breeze, and our bill was accurate. Enjoy this place. I have tried to accurately convey the details, but really the overall experience was great. If you want to stay at the Ritz and lounge on a beach; stay at the Ritz If you want to see Old San Juan or take a cruise, the Sheraton can't be beat for its location.","date":"2012-04-17 07:52:56 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4,"Check in \/ front desk":3,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Kraig Volkman","content":"This hotel is pretty mid-level. Although our stay included some hotel related injuries, the location is prime. We picked the hotel because of its close proximity to the pier (as we were taking a cruise). The location is perfect if you plan to take a cruise sailing out of old San Juan, as it is literally steps away from the pier. This was highly convenient. The bar and gill attached to the hotel and casino is great. They have great drinks, but the service is slow. Its a nice place to read a book or lounge around and people watch (when you aren't in a hurry). We actually ended up spending about 3 or 4 hours there after we checked out of our room (and we didn't want to wait in line to get on our cruise). While the wait staff is on the slow side, they make up for it with unexpected attentiveness- i.e. going out of their way to light your cigarette for you. The casino was sub-par. Not very interesting and I was nearly accosted by an over-zealous security guard who wanted to check my ID. He kept saying \"ID! ID!\" and then when I said I was staying in the hotel and started to look through my handbag for my ID and room key, he \"Puh!\"-ed me away and shoo-ed me. The gaming is just not worth it at this casino. The picture of the roof top pool are pretty deceptive. Its TINY, but has a good view. As always, with a hotel, watch out for the hot tub. My party and I went up all geared up for a soak, only to find a nasty couple making out in there and god knows what else yuk- so we didn't go in. BEWARE OF DOOR STOPS OUTSIDE THE BATHROOMS! Two people in my party were injured (one VERY badly). The door stops outside of the bathrooms were placed WAY too far out from the wall. We had to put the ice bucket over it since everyone kept tripping over the stupid thing. The rooms were just Meh. We had a wonderful view of a parking garage from our window. The room was clean, but nothing special at all, just your run of the mill bland, exactly what you expect from an airport hotel. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Also we enjoyed the bell boys, they were very friendly and gave lots of good advice.... Also if you stay in this hotel, you MUST MUST MUST eat dinner at Aquaviva (a few blocks behind the hotel).

The other night I got a call to say that my rental car interior lights had been left on and they were worried the battery would run down - that's service. Con's? I am struggling - there's one Muzak track with crazed trumpeting that opos up at night but that has been attended to, and something beyond the hotel's control is the traffic in the morning exiting the Discovery Gardens area - due to what seems to be totally inept traffic engineering and planning, there can be long queues to get into the one lane out of the place on weekday mornings. Similar problems can arise on the way back - but my tip is - southbound on Sheikh Zayed Road, take Discovery Gdns turn off, get into left hand lane as you cross on flyover, then after first lights, get into right hand land before left turn for ZiQoo, then don't join the inevitabel queue in left hand lane, stay in left hand straight ahead lane and when lights go green turn left from straight ahead lane. Perfectly legal and could save you 10 mins getting back here if you are driving. Other tips for British travellers, there's a nice if expensive Waitrose in Marina Mall less than 10 minutes away across Sheikh Zayed Road - great bread and other home comforts - free parking too (at the time of writing - Feb 2010). Been here a month already and about to extend for another. Highly recommended if you don't need to be in central Dubai and are working in Marina, Jebel Ali or Jumeirah Lake Towers areas of Dubai i.e on road to Abu Dhabi before Jebel Ali.","date":"2013-04-09 03:43:31 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":4,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Kimberly Sipes","content":"Decent Trip We just returned from the Iberostar Bavaro.Rooms:Great, beds excellent, nice layout and very clean.Resort:Grounds Impeccable, Layout is average.

Little wavy but lots of fun with the tubes we purchased on the caribbean street.Disco:The wing of a DC-6 airplane is the bar countertop, kind of cool. Not very busy but set in a cute plaza area.Dislikes: Shared services with the other two resorts. Too many trucks and mopeds on main walking paths. We stayed in 2401. Had trouble sleeping due to the operations at 4:30 am taking out the trash from the back of the restaurant. It was also close to the pool which was being renovated in the middle of the night, tile cutters buzzing at 2:00am. We then got extended checkout, which was really expensive $50pp, but we still had to pack up and move to a different room. If we had adequate rest we never would have needed extended checkout.

My husbnd and I stayed at this resort September 8th through the 15th 2008. Our room was wonderful. The service was great. The grounds were beautiful. Everything was great while we were there. We tipped in the restuarants and the wait staff never forgot us. My husband tipped the cook and a rib eye steak was his anytime. That was at the buffet. It wasn't until a month after we got home that we realized there was a problem. The fraud department at our bank called. Our bank account had been compromised from someone in the Dominican. We had stayed in Punta Cana and the charges were coming from Santa Domingo. My husband had only used his debit card at the ATM in front of the bank on the resort.I do remember that one day when we came back from the pool our safe was open. Of course I asked my husband and he said that he thought that he closed it. We checked everthing and everything seemed to be there.The bank believes that my husband's card was compromised directly from our safe. All the information about you is in the strip on the back of your card. Who ever compromised our account actually has my husbands pin number. So a word to the wise make sure you don't bring any cards with you, only bring travelers checks or cash. I'm not sure how safe either would be at this resort. I can't find an e-mail address to notify the resort.

Im 16 years old and my sister is 13, and we traveled with our parents. And this is a all inclusive (joke with the staff) is a great resort for everyone. room-Conveinent (spell?) to my mom we got connecting rooms which was easy to get inbetween ours and our parents rooms. I thought the beds were really comfertable and we got good night sleeps, and the maid service was amazing and everyday we came home to a clean room with flowers and chocolates. pool  beach-the beach was really pretty and the water was basically air temp. the only thing is for people who havent traveld or dont live in europe, may be offeneded by the topless beach goers. There was plenty of things to do on the beach like volleyball and snorkling, windsurfing, kyaking and much more. The pool was awsome and had activites to do as well as a pool side bar. the towels were convient because you could trade in yours anytime you wanted a fresh one. It was really clean as well and lunch is pool side.food-breakfast is a buffet but its like art and for dinner as well. the way they set it up is basically set for a picture.! the food at the buffet is good because they have so many things to choose from and an amazing dessert. the resturants are okay, they have cajun, mediterainian, and japanese and alot of other things. supprisingly the resutants arent that good, and becareful THEY DONT CLEAN THE SHRIMP, my sister and i are vegitarians and it actually was wast to find food, even without the shrimp. another great thing is that there is ALWAYS food.! if you miss a meal, there always is food by the pool.staff and entertainment-i CANNOT say enough good things about them.! they were the ones to make this vacation as great as it is.! There is always things to do during the day and the star friends always try to get people out of their comfort zone to participate, in a great way. Spagetti, pikachu, j.p, trebelin, and henry just to name a few were so funny always up for a laugh for example, dressing up in makeup and bikinis to take pictures with the guests on the beach.! the night shows were the BEST time of the day, both funny and dancing your mouth is either smiling, laughing, or just open with suprise.excursions and airport travel-the day excursions were fun but we only did the half day ones which pretty much took up a whole day. The only thing was the roads arent very developed so its a bumpy ride, same with the two and from airports. But it was all worth it.Overall it was a great trip.! we met people from all different places and all different ages.! i highly recommend this to anyone who wants an amazing vacation.!","date":"2013-12-26 22:09:40 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":3,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Herbert Hauck","content":"WONDERFUL!!!

The wedding photographer assigned to our wedding took many great shots and didn't mind family members taking pictures, either. The wedding coordinator was new to her job and did her best, as some of the smaller details were overlooked. The staff was very friendly, efficient, hard working and made sure you had a great time. The food at the buffet was plentiful and served hot. We never had a problem getting a spot at the pool or beach. The Dominicans appreciate any tips and remember those with better service and a big smile. Remember to bring lots of singles or smaller bills, as the front desk usual doesn't have change. The rooms were comfortable and cleaned early in the day by maids. My clothes did smell a little musty when I returned home, but were fine after washing them. We did the Stingray Bay trip and I would highly recommend this 1\/2 day experience. Hint: The hot water in the shower is not all the way to the left, but set the top of the knob to the 1 to 2 o'clock position to get hot water. The only complaint I had was the peacocks. They are beautiful, but make call to each other in the night and expecially early morning, which makes it had to sleep in. They nest in the palm trees or on the balconies.

We stayed from the 5th-19th May for our honeymoon and highly recommend the Iberostar Bavaro.Transfer time from Punta Cana airport 30-45mins. Getting through the airport was less painful than anticipated. We purchased our tourist cards in advance, but it cost twice as much. It did not seem any hassle at all to buy them at the airport upon arrival, which is what we wish we had done.Check in at the hotel was smooth, complete with Banana Mama upon arrival. We rented a safe in our suite for $2 a day.The junior suite was very impressive. I think we may have been lucky enough to get a recently refurbished room, no musty smells, air con worked fine, beds huge and very comfortable. Good size bathroom with separate shower cubicle and bath.Our suite was perfectly located for both the pool and beach. Blocks (which house 8 suites each) numbered 234,235 and 236 are in the same area. We were in 2365, a ground floor suite. 5 minute stroll to the lobby, bars and buffet\/restaurants.Its worth tipping the maid a dollar a day, it keeps the minibars well stocked with what we wanted and we are convinced that the lovely little touches the maid did to the room were as a result of tipping.Staff are friendly and helpful, good levels of service, it was near impossible to have an empty glass. Make sure you tip for good service, make the effort to pick up a few words in Spanish, it makes a big difference.We confirm that pathways are hazardous when wet. My wife tells me the paths are not for high heels, flat shoes are the way to go.Grounds are stunning and impeccably maintained and contain amazing wildlife.Huge pool with complete with swim up bar. The swim up section of the pool (about one third of the area of the pool) was closed for refurbishment from the 4th day and this was still going on when we left. It was disappointing, but its an all year round resort, so it has to be done at some point and I guess as the low season has just got underway and the rainy season is coming it seems a sensible time to do such work.Beach is by far the best we have encountered, a tropical paradise. No trouble getting a palapa, but if you insist on a front row palapa, get there by 9-9.30.Breakfast and lunch buffets are of good standard. For lunch, the poolside buffet offers a wider selection. We found the evening buffet below par. However we both suffered with stomach problems which took the edge of our appetite and could well have clouded our judgement and we may have been over critical because of this. Stomach problems or not the Gourmet restaurant was great.We ordered room service one night, took about 40 minutes and was of a decent standard.We tried hard to listen for construction noise throughout but could hear none. We ventured to the south side of the resort and did hear moderate construction noise. To avoid this being a problem within the suites try to avoid suite numbers starting in one (buildings 101-132). In our opinion, if you choose suite numbers starting in a 2 or a 3, you should have no problems.","date":"2014-12-22 06:08:32 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.hamersayhouse.co.uk\/","vacancy":true}

The people everywhere were great. Our last trip to Punta Cana was about three years ago and one comment we had at that hotel was the staff either were new to their jobs or not happy with them. Someone in an earlier post mentioned about buying a converter for the electrical. The rooms are wired for 110 and there is a flat prong outlet on the inside of the recessed round outlets. I brought an extension cord and ran a US appliance daily with no problems. I am not sure if the other persons room was different, but we had no problems in using the electrical outlets with our US appliances. Outlets are few and far between, if you want something by hte bed, bring an extension cord.FoodThe food was good, however, out of the 8 different all inclusive resorts we have been at, this buffet was probably one of the least impressive. The food was good and there were a number of choices, but there really wasn't much variety. A number of other resorts that we have been at have theme nights, which would have given a little more variety to the buffet each night. Also, another thing I have seen is for the restaurant to post what the entrees will be that day for the buffet. It just gives you an opportunty to plan where you want to eat. This would help at lunch, since you can not go in the buffet with a swimming suit on even dry. I wasn't going to change out of my suit in the middle of the day just to see what was on the buffet.The bar by the beach at night was a nice quiet place to unwind from the day after dinner. Randy was a great bartender. Our safe did not work after check-in, so the manager sent out a repair guy immediately. The safe worked, but I found out there was a trick to make it work, then there was no problem.Also, the circuit breaker popped one night when my wife was using the hair dryer in the room. The repairman was there very shortly to reset.  GroundsThe grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. I don't remember seeing any trash ever on the grounds and the beach was always the cleanest.One suggestion for everyone, use your safe. We were walking on the beach by the Ocean Blue resort and found a plastic bag with $475, 5 credit cards, drivers license and room key. We made sure the owner got everything back, but it was not easy. Use the safe. I would go back to this hotel, except we always explore something new.","date":"2013-11-25 18:54:47 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":4,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}},{"author":"Miss Rachael Wolf","content":"Loved the Dominicana AGAIN We have just returned from our 3rd stay at the Dominicana and can honestly say we enjoyed it just as much as our other visits.

After reading all of these reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect- I was pleasantly surprised that most of what people complained about seemed to be exagerated. Food- I could always find something to eat. If you are there for a week, the breakfast and lunch selections are repetitive, so try to not eat everything you see in the first few days. We made reservations for 2 nights. The Gourmet was the best. It was a 5 course meal with grilled lobster and amazing asparagus soup. The tropical restaraunt- The Marimba was also very good. We also went to the Rock Star Cafe two nights. The food is great and you don't have to make reservations. It is very small though, so I would recommend going right at 7.Room- Our room was fine. There was a slight musty smell, but there always is when you are in the tropics. The worst part of the room were the pillows. They were so flat, I am not sure why they even put them on the bed. Another thing to warn you about is the water in the bathroom- it smells. We had an old shower curtain that smelled horrible and had to ask the maid to bring another one. Pool and Beach- I was amazed at how many people laid on the beach. I have been traveling to Mexico for the last few years and everyone spends time at the pool- that is not the case here. We had an early riser in our group who saved chairs by the pool, but we wouldn't have had a problem getting chairs if we had slept in. The pool was very nice and was always being cleaned. The beach was very crowded with walkers from the other resorts. Lots of topless women that you probably would have rather not seen topless! Drinks- I was disappointed with the drinks. There was no consistency. Pina Colada's and Coco Loco's were frozen sometimes and on ice others- it was very frustrating because you never knew what you were going to get. Staff- The staff was always very nice to us. They speak little English so communication was not always easy but they would do everything they could to try to understand us. If you are planning on giving tips, you should bring small bills with you because there is not a place to get change. We did not leave the resort at all. We were very content with the kayaks, catamarans, beach and pool.

We booked through Apple Vacations. We flew USA 3000 which is an awesome airline. They first served us juice, then a breakfast sandwich and drink, the another drink and a snack. I can't believe they still provide service like this on an airplane! You are given free headphones to watch a free movie. On the trip down they were showing Home Alone and The Grinch on the return trip. AIRPORT You get off the plane and walk to the terminal which is basically just a hut with no air conditioner. Once inside your photo is taken with two Dominican ladies. You can pick this photo for $7 when you come back to go home. You pay $10 for a tourist card which they collect 5 minutes later. Everyone tells you to get a receipt for the tourist card, but they do not give them. We didn't have any issues about having the card when we left like others had previously written. When we got there they get you in and out FAST! When leaving, it takes a little longer to get out. Half of the airport is air-conditioned and half is not, so it can get a little warm. But the breeze keeps everything somewhat cool. BEWARE! You can only buy alcohol to take home at the airport after going through the initial security when you are leaving. Make sure that you keep the receipt that the shop gives you or security will ta ke it before you leave. They check everyone at the gate and they asked for my receipt for the two bottles of liquor we'd bought. They were going to take it if I couldn't provide a receipt. RESORT\/ROOMS The drive to the resort from the airport was approximately 40 minutes. The roads are very windy and bumpy. When we arrived, we were upgraded to a junior suite on the Bavaro side. We're not sure why.....Apple Vacations gives alot of upgrades or we've been to an Iberostar before. We stayed in building 3895. This was right by the beach. Our room was ok. The beds were really soft and we requested a king size bed, but received two double beds. We pushed them together and dealt with it. The room was kind of old. The air conditioner was leaking water all over the floor. We found a maid and asked for more towels to mop up the excess water (my husband gave her a couple dollars to help us). We never saw the maid again or our towels. We went into one of their storage rooms and found an old rug and some old towels to put on the floor to mop up the river of water. Our air conditioner quit working during th e last night, so it was rather warm. We were rationed to two bath towels, two hand towels, and two wash cloths each day. They fill the minibar with soda, water, and beer every other day. We left the maid one dollar with a note (in Spanish) asking for extra soda and she left it for us. In some of the previous postings, some people mentioned about getting bit by bugs. The only bug we saw was one roach that was on the floor of our room. We did not get any bites and I am usually the one that gets bit up. The resort is decorated with Christmas lights, Christmas trees, a nativity scene, and various other decorations for the season. Most of the trees have Christmas lights strung around them. BEACH Awesome! The sand is so soft. The water was pretty rough for the entire time we were there (red flags). At times the undertow was swift. It was fun to jump in the waves. I'm not sure if it is this rough all of the time or not. The water was cool, but after you got in it was fine. There are lots of palapas (umbrellas), but you must get down to the beach early to get one. There is a shopping area not too far down the beach. You must bargain with them or you will pay too much. My husband bought me a charm for my bracelet and the guy started the price at $60---and we ended up paying $15. If you have children, beware of the topless women. They are all over. It didn't bother my husband, but it might be awkward with children. POOL The pool was nice. It was a bit cool in temperature, but not too hard to get used to. The temperature was around 85 degrees every day and very nice at night. There's a juice bar between the Dominicana pool and the Punta Cana pool. They have really good smoothie drinks made with real fruit. The pools average depth is 5'9 which might require you to tippy toe around the pool in order to keep your head above water. Keep and eye on your children. FOOD The food was geared toward the Europeans. It was good, but not what we are used to. The buffet gets old pretty quick. We got one dinner reservation which we made for the Steak House. The only time they said that they had open was 9:30 pm. We made the reservations first thing when we got there. The reservation lady said to come back that day at 6:00 and she would call the restaurant and see if they could squeeze us in earlier. She got us in at 7:00. The food wasn't too bad, but nothing to rave about. You can wear shorts because this is an outside restaurant. The floor of the restaurant is sand so leave the dress shoes at home. The Star Rock Cafe was the best! This restaurant had steak, buffalo wings, hamburgers and much more. Each person gets an appetizer, main course, and a desert. This restaurant opens at 7:00 and you do not need to make a reservation. ;Shorts are ok too. The Sta r Rock Cafe has pool tables, tv's and a few video games. We did not get sick at all from the food. We stayed away from non-cooked foods and things that spoil after sitting out too long. I would bring Immodium and Pepto just to be safe. CASINO We went to the casino and played a little just for fun. We didn't win, but our money lasted for awhile. DRINKS We brought big cups from home. They are more than happy to fill these cups for you. The cups that they give you are kids size. We've learned this from other all-inclusive resorts. Not once while at the beach or the pool were we offered a drink. ENTERTAINMENT\/STAFF The shows were entertaining. The staff was friendly and tried hard to please. We didn't have too much of a problem with the language. Most of the employees can speak enough to take care of your needs. SUMMARY I would definitely return to this resort and Punta Cana. The resort is beautiful and well maintained. This is our 2nd Iberostar that we've stayed at and we would recommend the chain to anyone. The service we've received at both has been excellent. The only thing I would say is that the water in Punta Cana is not quite the beautiful blue that it is in Cancun\/Riviera Maya, Mexico. This resort is pretty much on the Atlantic Ocean not the Caribbean. They are building up the Dominican Republic and I think at some point it will be as built up as Cancun has become.","date":"2013-03-08 03:22:59 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":3,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Price Reilly","content":"\"fantastic resort\" Great hotel, I cannot fault this resort.The room was good, kept well clean, the maids did a great job,had probs with tap and air con but soon rectified.Resturant was clean and well presented and the food was exellent, although a second glass of wine was somtimes slow to be served.Pool area was very nice and clean and a dip in the pool was most enjoyable.Bars around the complex were well tended and we were quickly served the entertainment was ok, typical hotel but they worked hardThe resort itself was huge and you could walk along the beach in both directions the one way led to a market which you could browse they were very friendly folk but you had to barter, the beach outside the hotel was very busy and crowded as was the beach bar , sea was concerning with the motorised sport and the swimmers clashing .It was very hot and it did rain on a few occasons but it didn't spoil things.Yes this hotel was fantastic and the staff worked very very hard to keep it that way.ps look out for the flamingo's, peacocks, toads fish and terrapins and the white cockerel","date":"2012-09-24 11:19:08 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":5,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Josie Strosin","content":"The good, the bad, and the ugly. I stayed at the Dominicana with my family 7\/26-8\/02. Overall, the resort had a very European flavor to it. The food was probably more comfortable for Europeans but I found enough to eat. I am not a big fan of Speedo bathing suits so had to put up with that all week, but that is the European way. My guess is that only 20% of the guests were from the US.The good: The facility is fabulous. The grounds are beautiful and meticulously kept. The staff is friendly and, when they understand english, helpful. The pools are beautiful and well maintained. The beaches are clean and expansive. The room was a good size and was well maintained by the staff throughout the stay. There was plenty to do for my kids. We spent about equal time at the beach and the pool. The ocean has more waves than I anticipated and so the kids enjoyed playing in the water. The food had some good and bad (see below for bad). There was tremendous variety and although a lot of the food was scary, there was enough for me to find to be happy with. My wife had a harder time finding food that she liked. The kids also had some trouble finding good food. However, food was always readily available. The best place for lunch was not the main food place at the beach, but farther down the beach at the evening steak house. They had a relaxed uncrowded atmosphere with good food for lunch. The scuba diving was good but not the usual 100 foot visibility I am used to in the Carribean (more like 40-60 feet depending on the day). The best dive was on the wreck clearly visible from shore. For airport transfers I contacted Silva Transportation directly and for 7 of us it was $75 each way in a private airconditioned van. They were waiting for us whan we got off the plane and no problem getting us to the airport on time for departure. The watersports were fun (and free) with high-quality well-maintained Hobie Cats and ocean kayaks.The bad:The food had some flaws. The fruit was disappointing. Generally not ripe and lacking in variety. They apparently don't have oranges in the DR, because the OJ was more like Tang. Not the fresh squeezed I was expecting (like Cancun). The food overall catered more to the Europeans than the Americans. The specialty restaurants were good but not great. Avoid the Hard Rock wanna-be. It was lousy. The open bar was nice but the quality of the drinks was so-so. Fortunately the local beer is decent, cause it's the only one you can get. The diving overall was good, but we were treated like dive students. They are overly cautious and make you stay right with a dive master. We actually had one dive master leading us and another behind us on one of the dives (can you say moo?) I was half expecting someone to come and adjust my BC during a dive. The beach is very European. I was surprised at the amount of toplessness. It wasn't limited to stationary sunbathers -- there were plenty of women walking the beaches with their tops off. If you have kids beware. I realize this is a cultural difference between Europe and America, but I am an American and it made me uncomfortable, especially having children there. The pool is supposed to be no topless but the rule was frequently broken. The internet is expensive -- $5 per 1\/2 hour.The ugly: Half of our group came down with traveler's diarrhea despite the fact that we never left the resort.. You need to ask yourself if you are willing to take a chance on losing 1-2 days of your vacation by coming here. We spoke with other Americans and it was the same story with everyone -- half of the Americans came down with traveler's diarrhea. My understanding is that this problem is not limited to Iberostar, but is common throughout the resorts. The most distressing part is that traveler's diarrhea comes from an entero-toxic E. Coli bacteria that isn't supposed to be in food or water. It is a colon bacteria. Why I am I getting infected by a colon bacteria when I eat and drink the food at the resort? The answer is that there are some hygeine\/cleanliness problems. For this reason alone I would not come back to the DR and would not suggest it to others.","date":"2012-05-18 23:38:52 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":3,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":3,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Natalia Kilback Sr.","content":"Lovely resort, but I became sick and was hospitalized. OVERVIEW: We went to the Iberostart Dominicana Hotel Resort for four nights June 8-12, 2006. 鈥淲e鈥?were my husband, our two children (16 and 20) and myself. We thought the accommodations were lovely, the food okay but the whole vacation was marred by my getting so sick I was hospitalized. My husband got less sick and is still recovering now (it is Wednesday and we got back Monday night). My son only had a few stomach cramps and my daughter did not get sick at all. I say all this, because I don鈥檛 know why I got sick. The blood tests did not show anything so they assumed it was a virus. I think it had something to do with sanitation of the food or water. But I cannot be sure. ACCOMODATIONS: The hotel rooms were lovely and my two teenage kids said 鈥淕ood Job Mom鈥?upon arrival. The grounds were exquisite and I especially enjoyed watching the Flamingos. There was always a breeze at the ocean, so even on hot days we were comfortable sitting under a palapa reading and looking at the sea. It really was pretty. The rooms were spotless and very nice with a balcony. The marble-look bathroom was lovely. I was very pleased with the accommodations and the cleanliness.BEFORE: Before booking, I was very concerned about all the reports of sickness on Trip Advisor for this resort and several of the Dominican Republic resorts and almost didn鈥檛 book our vacation there. I was assured by our local Apple travel agent that they had sent hundreds of people to the D.R. and no one had gotten sick. I decided to go armed with food advice from a business associate who travels to the DR every month (he said he doesn鈥檛 eat any uncooked vegetables and only drinks bottled water) and a friend who recommended Pro-Biotics to ward off the intestinal blues (I checked with my Doctor who thought that was a good idea). I also brought Immodium and Pepto Bismal, recommended on Trip Advisor (a necessity...and bring it with you on the plane home. I saved a couple of people by having it on my carryon on the plane home). So I thought I was totally prepared to ward off any symptoms that would mar our vacation.We also brought a lot of 30 SPF and 50 SPF sunscreen. I also brought insulated mugs. I was the only one who really used one. I brought hats. We packed bug repellent, but didn鈥檛 need it. My son got a mosquito bite the first night and he wished I had hydrocortisone, but I never saw or felt any bugs. I was a good boy scout!PHOTO ID: Just to let you know if you have someone 16 (and I think anyone under 18), we only needed the embossed birth certificate. We did not need a photo ID for her to get into and out of the DR. Please note that starting Dec. 2006, ALL people of all ages will need a passport for ALL countries.OUR STAY: THE LONG VERSION:We arrived late afternoon on Thursday and found some food at the beach caf茅, which was very welcome since we hadn鈥檛 had lunch. Right away there was a problem getting bottled water. The bar did not offer it.Later we ate dinner at the buffet. I thought it was mediocre, but my husband liked it. I am not a big fan of buffets because I tend to eat a lot of everything and don鈥檛 feel satisfied. I was dismayed to find out we only qualified for one guaranteed a la carte restaurant meal since we were staying only 4 nights. After friendly questioning, I found out if you come back the morning of the day you want to get an additional reservation, they will book it for you if there is availability. We used our guaranteed reservation for the Steak House since that is what got the most rave reviews on Trip Advisor (I never ate there, but my family said the steaks were good and the rest mediocre). Friday morning we got a reservation at the Oriental Restaurant (the entr茅e was so overcooked, it was inedible. The sushi was good.).Friday morning we ate the buffet breakfast (one side is more American and one side European, though I don鈥檛 know which was which). I enjoyed the omelet made for me and we all loved the pancakes. There was always fresh fruit and lots of breads and jams and cereals. Breakfast was our favorite meal there. I will say from the very start I felt a panic on what was safe to eat and what wasn鈥檛. The restaurant didn鈥檛 have bottled water and that threw me for a loop. And the water had that sulphur taste of how the water used to taste near the beaches of the US. Didn鈥檛 mean it was bad, but made me feel uneasy. I checked with some other English speaking guests and they said they were told that all the ice and washing of food and drinking water was purified. I knew not to drink the tap water.There were bottles of water in the refrigerator but it looked like homemade labels and some of the bottles didn鈥檛 have labels at all. That did not breed my confidence. I checked, and all the caps were sealed. There was a gallon of water beside the refrigerator that had an expiration date on it and that made me feel more secure. All of this water tasted fine. I ended up feeling more secure about the gallon of water.At the buffet and the restaurants I waffled between going ahead and eating what I wanted and trying to avoid uncooked vegetables. There was a very good Gazpacho soup and I put cut up tomatoes in it. (was that what made me sick?) I ended up feeling uneasy about a lot of the choices because I just didn鈥檛 know what to avoid and what was fine. My husband ate it all, lettuce and everything. I preferred the taste of the bottled water in my room, so I brought that to the restaurant. This uneasiness was very uncomfortable to me. I saw other guests eating everything, but I had read so many reports on TripAdvisor of people getting sick, I just didn鈥檛 know what to avoid. I wished with all my heart I had brought my own bottled water so that I would know there was something completely safe to drink. Unfortunately, my uneasiness turned out to be valid.My husband and I both enjoyed the snorkeling in front of the Bavaro portion of the Iberostar resorts (facing the ocean go to the next swimming area to the right, past the couple of resort boats). We think the fish were almost like pets. Schools of blue tang followed us and swam under and around us. There were quite a few other tropical fish. The coral was mostly dead from hurricanes, but we did see some live coral and a few sea anemones underneath. We brought our own snorkeling equipment. There are at least two swimming areas roped off. At first we didn鈥檛 like that concept since we like to get to the reef, but after we were out there and the boats zoomed by only about 20 feet away from us, I felt safer knowing that I didn鈥檛 have to lift my head and wave every time a boat was near to show them I was there.My son paid for a windsurfing lesson ($39). He said it was very difficult. Not just because the balancing is so difficult, but because there were enough boats that kept going by he couldn鈥檛 really practice easily (both because of the boats and the waves, I think). He went to the disco a couple of times, but he said they were mostly older folks (30鈥檚 and 40鈥檚 and maybe even some 50鈥檚鈥?horrors!) and didn鈥檛 like it too well. He did do a beer drinking contest. One of the entertainment staff seemed to like him and that made him happy. Overall he really liked this resort. 鈥淏eautiful and the people were nice,鈥?he says.I felt completely safe with the kids going off by themselves. Usually they went together, but I also felt safe that my 16 year old daughter was by herself. The resort felt completely safe.My daughter got a massage and a facial and enjoyed it very much (about $75).My husband found a palapa easily every day any time of day. We found if you went to the right (facing the ocean) there were always vacant palapas. It was beautiful reading and looking at the ocean.ILLNESS:I wanted to explain to you the positives before I told you about the sickness. Friday afternoon I felt a little bit nauseous. In the middle of the night I ended up getting sick, both vomiting and diarrhea. I dragged the cushions from the little couch to the floor outside the bathroom so I could just crawl in. After a couple of hours I realized I was getting weak and probably dehydrated so I told my husband I needed to go see the doctor (I figured I needed a suppository since I couldn鈥檛 keep anything down) and that I needed a wheel chair because I couldn鈥檛 walk there. (the night before when we were walking around the little shops area, we noticed there was a 24 hour doctor clinic on site). Doug called the front desk and a golf cart came to the building and whisked us to the doctor.The doctor was a lovely well spoken woman. She explained I was dehydrated and needed IV and medicine to stop the nausea. She recommended I go to the hospital to get blood tests to determine exactly what was causing the problem so I could get the right medicine. She recommended we go by ambulance so that I could keep the IV going and in case I got sick again because of the jostling in the vehicle. She also told us that her consultation was not included in the resort and was $110. The ambulance was $170.She was clear to ask us if it was our choice for me to go to the hospital. We decided to go to the hospital to get the blood tests. We went by ambulance (although I thought he shut off the IV while the vehicle was moving and put it back on when we arrived. Go figure.)THE HOSPITAL:When we got to the hospital, the doctor there immediately told us he recommended I stay for 24 hours. I was surprised that he said that before any tests were completed. He explained that he thought I needed 24 hours of treatment to get the fluids back in and for any medicines to have a full treatment round via IV before I started the oral treatment. Doug found out the cost for a hospital stay would be around $1000 plus medicines for a day. (It ended up being $1070).We said we wanted to wait until we got the test results before we made our decision. Finally we agreed to have me admitted.They took me to a room that had a sweetness to it. It was a very comfortable bed with a blue and white patterned cotton bedspread. There was a small fabric couch and a recliner chair (maybe not so sanitary). It ended up I was very glad to be there because I had gotten very scared of all the food and drink at the hotel to the point I didn鈥檛 know what was safe. At the hospital I felt safe and I slept and slept and slept. I told my family they didn鈥檛 need to visit me (it was a $20 cab ride each way). The best thing they could do is thoroughly enjoy their vacation and call me once or twice. I thought it cool that there was a balcony there. After a day, I liked to go out there (my IV still in the room) to get a bit of fresh air. I wish all hospital rooms had a balcony.I watched carefully to see that they opened all the syringes fresh. I noticed a bit less than carefulness about their disposing of my used equipment. One time a part of the IV became unattached and there was some of my blood around it. The young nurse screwed it back together with her bare hands (a big risk for her and something you would never see in the States). All the nurses were very nice and young and didn鈥檛 speak any English. (I had been told that the Dominican Republic people are very lovely to look at and this gave me the opportunity to see a few of them. They had lovely bone structure and were very sweet.) A doctor came by three times with a translator. The doctor explained that the blood tests could not find anything. They figured it was a virus. When I asked if it could have been the water or food they said absolutely the hotel had to be using purified water or the whole hotel would have been there. Good point. But I am still not convinced that it wasn鈥檛 due to a slip of sanitation.Although I was mentally prepared for a 24 hour stay (9:30 am), I was dismayed when they kept me til 1 pm. But checkout was fast and easy.So, although I hope that no one else has to have this experience, if you do, you can know a bit of what to expect.My husband just came in while I am writing this and told me to add that he got the distinct impression if we had gotten travel insurance, we wouldn鈥檛 have had to pay anything there. Without it we had to pay up front and will need to ask our health insurance company to reimburse us here.Also note that he charged the Doctor鈥檚 visit and when he went to use the same charge card for the hospital bill the next day, it was refused. Turned out they refused it because he was in another country. Fortunately he had another card he could use. The credit card company told him he should always notify them before he goes to another country.By the way, I asked the hotel if they keep any records on who gets sick and who gets hospitalized. There was no interest or concern that I was sick nor records kept. My husband thought that it could be very useful for the hotel to note who was sick so that they could especially sanitize the room.As an interesting side point, on our shuttle from the hotel back to the airport, there was an American doctor and nurse also on the shuttle. He said it probably was a virus since I recovered so quickly. He mentioned that at the beach bar at the resort he was staying in (he was at a different one), when the bartender ran out of glasses, instead of getting more glasses that had gone through a dishwasher, he rinsed the used glasses out with tap water and reused them (note that the tap water is definitely not drinkable). He said it could have been something as simple as that and the reason I got so sick but my family didn鈥檛. MY OPINION: The way I figure it, the Dominican Republic is a lot like Mexico was 30 years ago when a lot of folks traveling there got 鈥淢ontezuma鈥檚 Revenge鈥? Over the years Mexico has solved the sanitation and water problem so that we can eat anything there (at least in the resorts) and not get sick. (By the way, I never got sick on any of my travels to Mexico even 30 years ago鈥?and I ate everything. We have also had no problems in Belize or the Cayman Islands as well as Western and Eastern Europe.). A part of me really liked the DR, the people are sweet and the resort was lovely. But I don鈥檛 know what I could do to feel okay about the food and drink. I think I would have to wait until the Trip Advisor reports weren鈥檛 mentioning so many sick visitors. (and next time I鈥檒l spend the extra money and stay at an island that doesn鈥檛 have these reports AND get travel insurance). By the way, my husband disagrees. He thinks we could have gotten sick anywhere. Hard to know. It is strange, but even though I got sick and was in the hospital, it was a sweet place and the hospital experience allowed me to meet more local people.I hope that this review helps and that wherever you go you have a wonderful and healthy time.I welcome any questions if you would like to email me.","date":"2015-01-10 19:49:16 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":-1,"Overall":2,"Rooms":5,"Service":4,"Value":3}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.pullmanhotels.com\/gb\/hotel-5309-pullman-london-st-pancras\/index.shtml","vacancy":true}

Here are a few thoughts\/experiences.While admitedly the bus trip from the airport had us wide eyed doubting our decision to go the the D.R., that section of road is an uncharacteristic view of the rest of the D.R..It took a while for us to unwind from the whirl of travel and the rush of our lives and settle into vacation mode. The lobby is welcoming tropical beacon. The landscaping in a word...gorgeous. The soft beach sand encourages long walks. All staff was friendly and usually multi-lingual. I loved practicing my Spanish, but English only is just fine.A rough guess of visitors prime language: 30% English, 20% French, 20% German, 20% Spanish.You could be as busy as you wanted or as relaxed. We had no problems getting pool side loungers or a beach pallapa. In addition to a large choice of optional non-stop organized activies, there was the; natural beauty, pool, ocean, food, and drinks. Each evening had different shows, bands, contests, and dancing. The talent was truely amazing. We especially liked the Grammy's and Broadway shows. The 2 night clubs go to 3am.We brought snorkle gear and snorkled to small reefs right off the beach, though extra cost day trips were far better for that. The waves at Punta Cana were not made for surfing or boogie boarding though other areas of the D.R. are different and known for that. Windsurfing and Hobie Cat sailing was great. Do sign up for tennis court time early each morning or be disappointed!On Punta Cana Beach the trade winds blow a steady 20 mph but pool side breezes were lighter. There were no mosquitos, or no-see-ums. Make sure to use sun screen or you will be sorry. That sun is hot. The ocean was about 72 degrees the pools about 78.Yes, the buffet food wasn't great. Not bad, but not great. The diversity of choices more than made up it. The seasoning were Carribean and different which is why I like traveling to foreign countries. The theme restauants were actually quite good by the way. Theme restauants request long pants and collared shirts for men. I saw no suit coats. Elsewhere else was strickly T-shirts, shorts, and swimwear.We drank only bottled water (the water at the restaurants is out of the tap)and had lots of iced drinks. We did not get ill.We took two day trips; The Marinaria and Bavaro Runners. Both were fun. The Runners trip showed the real side of the D.R. we had come to see. The road from the airport is not representative of the D.R. at all. If you do Bavaro runners - seriously - be sure to bring enough cash for souveigners; photo ops, coffee, cocoa, real cigars, massages, rum, jewelry, even a DVD about the D.R. with you in it. Yes, the rooms were simply O.K. but who spends that much time in their room? We visited other nearby resorts which were much more posh. At one I almost wished I had a neck tie - no thanks. Most others we visited made us glad we were where we were. The Dominicana was very comfortable. On an overall scale the resort was like a Raddison.Remember this is not America; which is why we went. Bring your sense of adventure. Have a Santa Libre or a Miami Vice at the bar. Get out...explore and by all means try to pack light.","date":"2015-12-23 12:26:20 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":-1,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Marc Conroy","content":"Great vacation! Just returned from a week at this resort (Feb 4-11). There were 6 in our group and we all had a great time. We went through Apple Vacations, which we have used before, and there were no problems here.Upon arriving at the airport, we got our $10 tourist cards, which were then taken from us after being stamped. We thought we needed them to leave, but apparently not. Do make sure when you leave that you get immigration forms from either your Apple rep or at the airport when you check in.Got our luggage and found the Apple people; they directed us to our transfer bus. Beware of the porters trying to act like they work for Apple; they are just looking to take your luggage to the bus and then want a tip. It鈥檚 not that far to the bus, so if you can manage your luggage by yourself, do it. About 陆 hour ride to the resort. The room was very spacious and was always very clean. Air conditioning worked very well (almost too well for me, but hubby likes the room very cold!) You will more than likely need the outlet adapter; but as others have stated, they sell them in the store by the lobby. Also, there are no clocks in the rooms.Headed to the buffet for the first night and found lots of good things to eat. We ended up only having dinner at the buffet on 3 of the nights. We ate the other nights at the Steakhouse, Mexican, Tropical, and Star Rock Caf茅. They were all very good. Reservations are required for all but the Star Rock. Star Rock has open seating from 7-9 PM. And contrary to what you might read, of these 4 restaurants, long pants for the men are only required for the Mexican restaurant. Now that doesn鈥檛 mean you can wear your swim trunks and $@!#% flops to the others; should wear nice 鈥淏ermuda鈥?type shorts to the Steakhouse and Tropical. More casual clothes (i.e., jean shorts) are fine for the Star Rock. The Steakhouse, Mexican, and Tropical all have small buffets for the appetizers; thought the Mexican was the best on this.As for breakfast and lunch, the buffets are what they are 鈥?buffets. If you鈥檙e expecting 5-star cuisine, you鈥檒l be disappointed. Thought the breakfast buffet was very good 鈥?you can get eggs and omelettes made to order; loved the pancakes and the sugar donuts. Tip on the pancakes 鈥?they only make them on one side; a plate gets made up and carried to the other buffet. So if you want the freshest ones, get them from the side where you can see the guy actually making them. Yes it is basically the same thing every day, but how much different can you get with breakfast? There鈥檚 all the basic breakfast stuff, and some things that Americans don鈥檛 think of as breakfast foods, but apparently are normal for Europeans.The lunch buffet down by the beach was pretty good; I usually had pasta and fish or chicken of some kind (and fries and nachos!). And they cook up something on the big grill outside; paella a couple of the days, brats and burgers another day. It maybe got a little repetitious, but we never went hungry. Our big limitation on the buffets is that we don鈥檛 eat any of the salad or fruit 鈥?just think this is why a lot of people get sick. Ice cream stand next to the beach buffet was very good.Beach was very beautiful and we never had any problems finding beach chairs or a palapa. But, we are also early risers and were usually settled in by 9:30 or so. Sort of a 鈥渟hortcut鈥?to get to the beach: exit the building from the opposite side from the pool\/elevators. There is a nice straight walkway all the way to the beach. If you exit the other way, the walkway kind of meanders through the grounds, you have to go around the pool, and through the tables outside the buffet.Also, grounds are very nice and well maintained. There are a few flamingos and peacocks, and most days we saw George the rooster strutting his stuff.As for the Europeans vs. Americans thing 鈥?yes it is predominantly Europeans, but we never had a problem with rude Europeans as some people have talked about in other reviews. If anything, it was the Americans we had a problem with. We encountered several cases of Americans on the beach who felt the need to talk non-stop and did not seem to have any volume control. It鈥檚 no wonder Americans get a reputation of being loud and obnoxious. This seemed to be more of a problem when we were on the Punta Cana side of the beach one day.Service by the bartenders and bar waitresses was good. We do tip these people, so that might be part of the reason for the good service. We found other staff to be very friendly. Would like to have had a better selection of liquor; Iberostars in Mexico seemed to do better in this area. But, the El Presidente (draft) was always cold and my husband enjoyed the Bohemia beer (bottled). Seemed to only be able to get the Bohemia in the minibar in your room or at the lobby bar.We did the Marinarium snorkel excursion and that was a lot of fun. The nurse sharks were very cool (and very large!!). Saw some interesting fish and the coral was OK, but we have gotten spoiled in that we don鈥檛 usually snorkel with large groups of people, so that was the only downside.All in all, it was a great vacation and a much needed break from the Ohio winter!","date":"2015-10-15 16:40:36 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":-1,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Modesta Moen","content":"100% GREAT TIME - very satisfied       Me and my boyfriend on the beach","date":"2013-06-30 18:28:48 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":-1,"Overall":5,"Rooms":3,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Luther Hayes","content":"Great resort, with one exception I just returned from a stay at the Iberostar Dominican with my husband and we had an excellent time, despite a medical emergency we experienced while there. I will reiterate the positive comments previously posted about the hotel: great pool, excellent beach, clean rooms, great service. The food was good and presented us with no health problems. The one warning I have about the hotel is about the 24 hour medical clinic. My husband had a little accident while on an excursion and it was obvious that his collar bone was broken. Other American travellers advised us not to go to the local hospital. The medical staff at the resort clinic was of absolutely no help at all. They could not supply us with a sling or pain killers of any kind. It was obvious they had little medical training and did not care about my husband's welfare. Shortly after the accident occured, my husband passed out in our room and was unconscious for close to a minute. I called the medical clinic for help but by the time they arrived he was awake and back in bed. I was told that I should not have bothered them. We had to wait 2 days to fly back to the States because the number of flights out of Punta Cana are limited. At the hospital back here in the US, we found that he had a broken collar bone, 6 broken ribs and a concussion.I hope this information can act as a word of caution to anyone who may have medical problems or to those who are accident prone. The resort is excellent, but not equipped for an emergency.","date":"2014-04-13 04:56:01 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":-1,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Miss Jazmin Schiller","content":"would recommend but wouldn't go back I travelled with my husband 43 daughter 20 and son 16, 15 - 29 August. We travelled with Direct holidays from Gatwick, the flight was horrendous. Left Gatwick at 11 am after 30 minute delay and then touched down in Manchester to pick up passengers and were delayed here another 2 hrs 45 minutes. Eventually arrived at the resort 9 pm Dom Rep time. We were very annoyed because we were told by Direct Holidays that we couldn't board in Manchester because there was no availability even though we booked in September 2004, then we had to off load at manchester due to a shortage of flight crew and had to re board, so why couldn't we have just got on at manchester in the first place? beyond me! We landed at La Romana airport but would advise against this as it was a 2 hour drive to the hotel, fly to Punta Cana, I would even pay a bit more for my holiday if I had the choice. We were advised to take malaria tablets due to 4 cases reported from this area by English tourists who are now suffering. This is since the 2004 hurricane.When we arrived at the hotel it was one of the best sites I have ever seen. It usually takes me a few days to relax and get into it, but the stress was taken away instantly and I new I had arrived in paradise. Check in was quick and smooth with our cases brought to the room within minutes of walking through the door. The rooms are a bit dated but large, immaculately clean, comfortable beds, lounge area with TV, well stocked mini bar and plenty of bottled water, which is not tampered with as some people have stated. There is also an electronic safe which is big enough to put a video camera in as well as all other valuables. The bottle opener is on the wall in the bathroom. There is a hair dryer in the bathroom and also shampoo and body wash dispensers on the wall next to the shower. We were in rooms 3242 and 3244 with a view of carribean street, not brilliant but very quiet. Just leave the maid a note to let her know what drinks you want re stocking in the mini bar, we did leave her tips now and then but she would have done so without. The main reason we left her tips was because she looked after our daughter one day when she had to stay in doors due to sickness and diarhoea - and thats another story. We all suffered with it through out the 2 weeks we were there. It did spoil the holiday some what as we had to make sure that we were always close to the toilet. After a visit to the pharmacy it was confirmed that we were all suffering from food poisoning along with the rest of the holiday makers we spoke to. When you consider the hygene standards of certain nationalities then it's not surprising food poisoning is so common, i was following other women out of the toilet who weren't washing their hands and then going over to the the self service drinks area and touching glasses, I was astonished and sickened.The grounds are beautiful, gardens with ponds, flamingos, peacocks, ducks and a big fat cockerel that likes to watch the entertainment (well thats what they call it) in the evening. There are 2 swimming pools, one for each hotel building. The Punta Cana and Dominicana are identical buildings stood opposite each other with all bars and restaurants shared between the 2. The Punta Cana is quieter with its own lobby bar and a small band playing in the evening where you can have a dance if you wish. The local music is bachata which to be quite honest I found a bit boring, I was looking forward to some salsa but apart from day time lessons it was never to be heard in the evening. The bars are plentyfull around the resort and the food is literally 24 hours. The evening entertainment was not up to much, people were comparing it to Butlins but to be honest I wouldn't insult Butlins. The star friends do work very hard organising games in the day time and putting on the shows at night, I could name a few of them but not all as the entertainment team do not form part of our holiday enjoyment. The kdis did go to the disco a few times but not as often as they normally would due to sickness and diarhoea attacking intermitently. The only other complaint I have is that the beach bar shut at 11 pm, my husband and I thought this was the most relaxing place to sit and have a chat and just watch the sand crabs at play, it was blissful. Now for the beach, WOW, it is awesome, white powder sands, clear turqoise sea and seaweed cleared every morning, but does build up again later in the day. Because of designated swimming areas the sea did get crowded and this created sand churning so the sea was not so clear for the rest of the day. I was up and on the beach every day by 7.30 am and if you werent out there by 9 then you would have no chance of a sun bed as they would all be reserved by this time. To say that this is damned annoying is an uderstatment and the worst culprits were the Americans who I found out are not only greedy with food but everything else, they would reserve sunbeds for each body in the shade and the same amount of beds in the sun, then walk away and come back 3 hours later, I dont see any reason why the rule of no reserving can not be enforced, there is enough staff around the place. The same problem happened at the 2 pools also but we only layed around the pool on 2 days as we much prefer the beach. Topless bathing is allowed on the beach but not by the pool. It's does state in the brochure that all none motorised sports are included, what it doesn't say is that you have to first pay $40 for a briefing lesson prior to taking out the kayaks and wind surf boards. It also states that pool is included in the all inclusive, but again there was a charge of $1 a game.The staff are really friendly, from the grounds staff to the hotel manager. Every one speaks English contrary to what the travel brochures state. I did speak in Spanish when ever possible and this was appreciated and corrected where necessary with a smile.The food - 2 buffet restraunts for breakfast, lunch, dinner and midnight snacks. 2 buffet restaurants next to the beach, one at each hotel which served food from 10 am until 5 pm and the choice of food was enormous, I would defy any one to be picky at this hotel. Fish was in abundance so, if like me you love any kind of fish then you will be in fish heaven, from sardines to salmon and lobster. We even had champagne for breakfast as this is inlcuded also. Cocktails that would put Tom Cruisie to shame, my daughter and I did justice to the strawberry daquiries as our afternoon tipple and then followed with a fitful sleep on the beach! We also visited some of the a la cart restaurants, make sure you book all a la carts at the start of your holdiay as they get booked up pretty quick. 4 days before we were coming home I wanted to book the gourmet but it was full up every evening. The oriental (not up to much), the steak (excellent) nothing was too much trouble for these guys, the tropical we visited on our daughters 20th birthday and I whispered to the head waiter that it was her birthday and could the staff please sing happy birthday to her, they did more than that, at the end of our meal they turned out all the lights and carried out a huge cake with 4 candles on it and all the staff and guests sang happy birthday, the cake was too big for us to eat it all so my daughter told the staff to share it after they had finished work, we left a good tip to be shared among all the staff and this was appreciated not expected. And the food was excellent. Didn't try the gormet or mexican but did hear they were also excellent. Dress code is not strictly enforced in the a la cart's which i found dissapointing, I dont want to sit in my finery while the guy on the next table is wearing jeans\/shorts and a t shirt. They were strict in the buffet restaurants, turfing out any body wearing beach shorts and sleeveless t shirts at dinner. We also ate one night in the Rock Star cafe, OK but didn't go back even though reservations aren't required.Wine - which was good, beer and soft drinks are served at lunch and dinner in the buffet restraunts and champagne at breakfast. The food in the buffets was very good with lots of choice for every one. Do go steady with the salads as the pharmacist warned this is where the food poisoning could be lurking, so be warned. The coffee was excellent quality as were the cheeses and deserts. If you smoke there is a smoking section in all restaurants.We did 2 trips which we felt were very expensive but enjoyable. The jeep safari costing 拢70 each was informative of Dom Rep life and a swim on Macau beach at the end was most welcome. My husband and son swam with sharks which they felt was a bit of a rip off as they only actually spent 1 hour in the water and at 拢50 for an afternoon was pretty steep. My daughter and I spent a blissful afternoon in the spa being pampered and as high class hotels go the treatments weren't that expensive.If you want to shop i recommend you steer clear of the hotel shop as it is ver, very expensive. My husband did buy some hand rolled cigars from the hotel cigar shop and the quality was excellent. Further up the beach past the Bavaro are some shacks selling almost anything and this is where we did our souvenier shopping, be prepaired to haggle, we ended up paying a quarter of the asking price.There is also a casino which made a pleasant alternative some evenings as overall we came out $140 dollars up. We didn't play the tables only the machines and won jackpot 3 times on different machines. Drinks are also included in the casino.We had a fantastic family holiday and probably our last together as the kids are wanting to do their own thing next year, so we had a great holiday to remember for ever. Would I go back, the answere has to be no because of the food poisoning but we will definitley be going back to the carribean, probably Barbados.Don't hesitate to email me if you wish to know anything that I may have forgotten to report.","date":"2013-10-27 13:02:35 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":-1,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Enola Stoltenberg","content":"overall it was brilliant I had a great time at the iberostar dominicana.

My family and I just returned from a two-week holiday at the Iberostar Punta Cana. I flew out of JFK on a non-stop American Airlines flight. It was great! The plane was not crowded. I traveled with my husband and two children ages 2.4 and 1.1 years. Both children did not get much sleep the night before. They both fell asleep about one hour into the flight. Lucky me! The plane arrived half hour early at 11:00 a.m. Once you exit the plane the hot and humid air hits you right in the face! It was a smooth exit from the airport. I was one step ahead of the game because I purchased my tourist cards at the consulate in New York and had them already filled out. I headed straight for Customs. My bags came right away. I did not have ground transportation to and from the airport. I was told you can grab a cab as soon as you exit. The advice was correct.I had an air-conditioned van for $24 USD. The ride to the hotel was a little scary. However, I wasn鈥檛 surprised because the roads are similar to my grandparents city of Coamo, Puerto Rico. Going towards the hotels in PC there are two lanes. One going and the other coming. If you want to pass the very slow moving vehicle in front you would have to go into the oncoming traffic lane to pass the vehicle. This is scary. However the Dominicans are used to driving like this so I wasn鈥檛 concerned. I was also not surprised on how some of the poor people live. The housing is called shanty-towns 鈥淢ake Shift Homes鈥? I am familiar with this because I traveled to RIO and the poor people live like the same. Well to get off the subject and on to the hotel.Of course there was only one person at the reception and his last name happened to be RUIZ which is my mothers last name. He spoke English but I spoke in Spanish. I gave the guy $30 to upgrade me to a Junior Suite. I could have given him less because he didn鈥檛 even ask for money. The Junior Suite was nice but it was not conveniently located. The Junior Suites are located near the front entrance of the property. The front entrances is close to the buffet and Japanese restaurants. The suites have double or king size bed with a small table and chair a sofa and a very nice bathroom with a big tub. The downside of this location is that it is a far walk to the pool and beach. Not a big deal if I was married with no kids. But shelping beach stuff with two kids in toe is difficult. The same day I went to the front desk and ask to speak with the manager. The manager鈥檚 name is Mr. Coleman. He is a very nice gentleman and has a way with words! I guess that is why he manage鈥檚 all three hotels Punta Cana, Dominicana, and Bavaro. I asked if there was anyway he can get me a standard room closer to the beach. He pleasantly advised to come and see him the next day around 2:00 p.m. and he will see what he can do. Well patience paid off because he gave us a family suite! The family suite was located on the second floor hop skip and jump from the pool area.The suite was two rooms. The first had a king size bed, sofa bed, TV and bathroom. The other connecting room had two double beds w\/ a TV. Both rooms had a patio with table and two chairs. It was really nice. I also asked for a crib it was clean and it served the purpose. The decore is a little outdated but the rooms serve the purpose. Pool  Beach  FoodThere are two pools side by side one for Dominicana and the other for Punta Cana. They were a good size but would have like a bigger pool. But then again who goes to the carribean to sit in a pool. The sun is strong to the pool water gets warm. There is a lot of space for kids to place. There is also a baby pool. The pools are kept very clean. The first week of arrival was not crowded so I did not need to reserve a sun shade. As the week past I found I had to wake up in the morning for the prime spot. Only because I had kids. The beach is absolutely beautiful. This is where I spent my entire vacation. I set up shop on the first row of huts. So I was two steps from the pools and two steps from the beach and right between the beach buffets! The front of the Dominicana pool is the activity side. They have lots of games provided by the wonderful star friends. I danced Merengue and my 2 year old sun did too! The ice cream at the La Cana is way better than the La Yola Icecream Stand. The La Cana has rotisseree chicken that is great better than the other buffet. BUT the buffet near the dominicana has frenchfries with cheese, rice and beans, etc. More of a selection.Food and RestaurantsI was pleasantly surprised that the food was pretty decent. I mean come on you are in the Dominican Republic not NYC! The buffet is an open air restaurant so you will see flies. Some people freak out. They are not swarming all over the food. They basically annoy you at the tables. I have a great tip. Take a napkin and place it over your food while you are eating. Leave a small opening. No flies will come. It worked. I did this the entire week. People must have thought I was crazy. I had low expectations of the food and brought every medication in gods creation. I only got sick once for a 陆 day took Ammodium AD pills and walla it was gone! At the buffet they have steaks made to order. Rice, Vegees, Pork, pasta, pizza, etc. I stayed away from the salads but I found everything was temperature controlled. I found them checking the temperature of the cold foods often, which is a good thing. The were constantly cleaning up. First couple of days I tipped the waiters for getting me water and soda but it was easier just to get it myself so I stopped tipping after the first week. Another tip is to make sure you eat your food well done. The pork shoulder is cook well. But the little cuts of meat (steak) is not cooked well. They just brown the meat to meet the demand of people. Just ask the cook to cook it more well done and you won鈥檛 get sick. This is why I had to take Ammmodium AD because I ate a raw piece of steak.A lot of people get sick because they drink too many of those frozen drinks. The frozen drinks are very sweet. Especially the coconut ones; these are pure laxatives! Hey if you drink in the sun and eat a lot you will get sick! I met a couple from PA and he was drinking lots of RUM. I said to him that you better slow down buddy you will get sick. He said nahh! I drink all the time and sure enough he was in the room the entire day sick as a dog with diareara. Lucy鈥檚 ClubThis club is for children 4-12? The club was small but they do have lot鈥檚 of games, movies and various indoor\/outdoor activities. There is a staff of two. During the crowded point of my stay I saw about 12 children walking from one activity to another. There was one girl in the front and one in the back making sure everyone played follow the leader. The girls understand English quite well but speak a little English. They did a great job at the Mini Disco which is held nightly. It鈥檚 repetitous but that鈥檚 because they want the kids to follow them. They march, dance and do play skits. It鈥檚 really cute. My son loved the mini disco even though he was only 2.4. He danced around the stage by himself at times! and tuckered himself out that when we went back to the room he fell asleep really fast. IT was wonderful! The girls work really hard because again this is not there end of the day. They start at 10am and work until 10 pm. That鈥檚 a long day. Make sure you tip them. One of the girls lived in Santo Domingo and goes home every 11 days!I would recommend this resort for everyone. It鈥檚 a great chain. If you like to party stay on the Domincana side. If you like peace and quite stay on the Punta Cana. Remember the Dominicana side has everything from the shows, casino, etc. RUDE PeopleBefore departure I read numerous posts about people being rude (ie. Americans and Europeans). I always have an open mind when I am on vacation because who wants to argue? Well that statement was short lived. I guess because I was one week and five days into my vacation and the buffet was getting to me. I was standing in front of a dish that had ONE hot dog left. I had a plate in my hand with three hot dog buns (mind you my son was hungry). A gentlemen was using the thongs to pick up a piece of steak. I was waiting for those thongs because I have proper etiquette. Well long behold this French guy behind me (who see that I am waiting for the thongs with three buns in tow!) reaches over me and grabs the hot dog with his fingers!!!! I couldn鈥檛 believe it! That really ---- me off. I told him nicely that I was waiting for the thongs to get the hot dog and he pretended that he didn鈥檛 speak English. Well since he did that my husband went up to him and told him he was an ----. I knew he understood because a few minutes later he was sitting one table away speaking English to his friends. Go figure. The buffet at Lunch is like going to a High School Cafeteria. Everyone for themselves. Well that was my experience at the Buffet.","date":"2013-04-13 02:21:32 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":-1,"Overall":5,"Rooms":3,"Service":4,"Value":5}},{"author":"Aaliyah Daugherty","content":"The food was really bad, but... We have stayed at the Iberostar in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico, for the past three years and loved it. This spring we decided to try the Dominican Republic for a change. The weather and beaches were excellent. The resort itself was not up to the same standars as the Quetzal, in Mexico. I don't think the Dominicana should be considered a 5 star. The rooms were smaller, not as clean, and in need of minor repair. For example, the shower was really not operational. We complained, but no action was taken. The air didn't work very well either. The room had some peeling paint, and cracks in the tub and bathroom floor. Our biggest disappointment was the food. It was just awful. We are not picky, and can eat just about anything. I don't plan vacations around eating, but this was really bad. They were always running out of everything too, from ice to silverware to cups to fries. There were not enough staff, and the tables were dirty. We found none of these problems when we stayed in Mexico. Another thing was the staff was not nearly as friendly or helpful as in Mexico. Actually they were somewhat rude!! We found many more European tourists in the D.R., and a lot more topless!!

It is a must for anyone looking for a fantastic relaxing holiday with activities on hand if you want them. The all inclusive nature means that you don鈥檛 take any money with you as all food, snacks, drink, water sports, and activities is included. We had the best time and are definitely planning to go back.  Travel Company: We flew with Direct Holidays through My Travel and paid for an upgrade to Premier Class. The flight was great and the upgrade was well worth it for the free drinks and extra legroom. However the crew were a bit snooty.  The Staff: The staff go out of their way to ensure that you are happy and encourage you to join in with all the activities such as aerobics, darts, shooting, football etc. The 鈥榮tar friends鈥?organise the day activities and at night put on shows in the theatre, which are great, fun and good to watch whilst sipping on one of the many cocktails.  The Food: The food was amazing and I'm a very fussy eater but every night was spoilt for choice. The main buffet restaurants are full of salad platters, meat platters, and have an amazing array of hot foods. The speciality restaurants are also great and the beach side steak restaurant was fab. At lunchtime you can chose to eat either in the buffet restaurant or down at 1 of the 2 beach bars\/restaurants. The drinks are great to; good wine, beer and all the iced cocktails are to die for. Everyone tells you to beware of buffet style servings and not to eat fruit or veg, but we ate it every night and weren鈥檛 ill once during our 2 week holiday  The Rooms: The rooms are great and the junior suite that we had was huge. There is a slight musty smell, but I have found this in many hotels in tropical resorts due to the humidity. All you need is to pack a small fragrance candle and the scent of that will solve the problem.  The Activities: After eating so much every day, all day, I had to keep my size 8 beach body trim so I did the aqua and beach aerobics. It鈥檚 great fun and a good 30 mins of exercise. The tennis courts are also included in the price and the courts are great to play on in the late afternoon.  The Pool  Beach: The pool is huge, and very clean. There is a slight problem with early rises reserving sun beds, but my advice is head to the wonderful beach. Usually we are pool people, but the sand is so nice and white and the water fairly clear that you鈥檒l probably end up there every day. Plus there is a lovely breeze that comes of the ocean that you need to cool you down, cause it is hot!!! Unlike neighbouring hotels, Iberostar Dominicana has parasols for shade on the beach and the seaweed is cleaned away from the sand every morning.  This hotel is 1st class, and you will not be disappointed.","date":"2014-06-05 19:19:19 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":-1,"Overall":5,"Rooms":-1,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Jazmyn Olson","content":"Loved it and will go back I have just come back from Punta Cana Domenican Republics, and I stayed at the Iberostar Domenicana.

The animation team was also spectacular, always doing activities, and inviting us to dance and participate in the shows.The food was everything you would want.. from seafood, to meats, veggies, and fruits.

The whole hotel is actually kept clean at all times.. the grounds are constantly attended, and you feel like in your own little world.I would go back to Punta Cana in a second, especially to stay at the Iberostar.I do not have any compliants, but if you are going with children many europeans go topless, it took some getting used to.I recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit Punta Cana.

This 8-day stay was superb as a relaxing yet adventurous vacation.

It doesn't get much better than that! A siesta by the water with a nice tropical breeze...wow! The room was clean, the air-conditioning worked well - so much so that we usually turned it off at night as to not awaken to frigid temps in the morning. Plenty of bottled water was provided for in room consumption. The shower\/bath was nice and big with a nice added touch of a hand held wand to help rinse sand off. We had perfect weather up until the second to last day when it rained all day but that didn't stop us or many others from strolling out around the resort or beach and it was a perfect day for catching up on some sleep from the earlier excursions we had taken. The Outback Safari is very enlightening for those who need to experience the countryside culture and the trip into Santo Domingo is also a good excursion to experience the city culture.

I love that it is in conjunction with the Iberostar Punta Cana. Make sure you go over to the Punta Cana Lobby\/Lounge. It is really beautiful. That's where we spent alot of nights drinking wine. They have a band there every night too. Check out some of the shows at the Dominicana. They have a different theme everynight. They are also big on audience participation, so if your not into that make sure you sit in the back! There is a Rooster named George that sits in the 2nd last row every night. He is absolutely adorable. He loves to be petted! Depending on where your room is, he will probably be getting you up in the morning too. By the way - if you have previously requested anything specific about your room ie: view, bed size etc. you probably won't have it when you check in the first night. This seems to be the norm, judging by all the reviews that I have read on various web sites. Don't sweat it. Simply let the front desk know. They couldn't change us the first night we were there, but by noon the next day we were exactly where we wanted to be! (We have had to change our rooms in Vegas practically every time we go there too! Nothing that can't be fixed!) FOOD - It was GREAT. The buffets had huge varieties to choose from every night. Different themes too ie: italian, seafood, mexican etc. Their pizza is awesome!!! My husband who is a very picky eater ate pizza everyday and never got sick of it. He is also close friends with the guy who works at the Ice Cream bar by the beach. I'm pretty sure he consumed most of the chocolate ice cream on the island! As for me, I ate everything! Seafood, Chicken, Beef, Pork, Fruit, Veggies. You name it, and not one gastronomical problem! PLEASE REMEMBER THAT EVERY DISH IS NOT COOKED EXACTLY THE WAY IT IS IN NORTH AMERICA!!! So when you go to the Mexican Ala Carte restaurant, don't expect it to be just like Chi Chi's. DO TRY the Ala Carte restaurants. It does break up the buffets. The American Restaurant does not require reservations, but be there right around 7pm when it opens, because there are not alot of tables and you could end up waiting awhile. Again there food it not just like home, but try it all anyway. We ate there alot. POOL - Yes, you have to get up early and claim a chair\/palapa. It is an unwritten rule and if you want to lay by the pool, it's what you've got to do. Don't fight it, just do it. If you are a joiner, then pick a chair on the Domincana side of the pool. (That's where all the activities occur) Otherwise, if you just like to read and soak up the sun (like us) hang out on the Punta Cana side. Very nice pool by the way. BEACH - We had the niciest beach by far. My husband walked an hour in either direction of our beach, so we know this to be a fact! If you can't get up early to put out your towels, you can always find chairs out on the beach. THE LOCALS - I can't say enough great things about them! They are so friendly, always have a smile on their face, helpful, kind, just wonderful people period. The Iberostar Star Friends are a real hoot! SUMMARY - Take everything in stride! Be prepared for alot of topless(ness) and speedos. YOU ARE NOT AT HOME, so please keep an open mind in regards to everything. It's called WHEN IN ROME people. Only you can ruin your vacation by being narrow minded. The few negative reviews I had read befor I went, just made me more determined to have a good time.Please feel free to ask me any questions. I would be happy to help!","date":"2012-01-24 07:46:46 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":5,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}},{"author":"Enid Lubowitz","content":"Beautiful hotel, average food I am a native Dominican that just went back after 5 years of being away from home. I spend 2 days at the Iberostar Dominicana. The hotel itself is beautiful. The rooms are very spacious and clean and very comfortable. The people of the Dominican Republic will be one of the friendliest and nicest people that you will ever come across in your travels, I guarantee that. The staff at the hotel was no exception. They learn a little of all languages just so that they can ask you how are doing and how you like your stay. The beach at Dominicana was just gorgeous and the pool at the facilities are also very inviting.My only complaint with this hotel is the food. Although there was a lot of variety I must say that the food was pretty bland. I was shocked to see that there were no dominican foods at the buffet. This hotel would get much better reviews if it wasn't for the food. I can't understand why there was no authentic dominican food. It's one of the more delicious cuisines in the world!!While I was there there was also a power outage that lasted for a at least an hour. I had never seen that happen at a hotel.

The place was just as we expected! great value for money. the beaches were fab. the pool had plenty of space and getting sun loungers were no problem. the weather was extremely hot and we ended up using factor 25 for the first few days. got cracking tans. there was plenty of chioce for the food - main restaurant was buffet style with something for everyone, the menus changed everynight. the other restaurants were good on the whole especially the steak house, although we werent too impressed with the mexican. plenty of chioce availabale for alcohol too with many branded products such as smirnoff - just ask!the rooms were good, our freinds got a free upgrade to a suite. ours smelt a bit musty at first but hey, what can you expect your in a hot humid place! the maid service was spot on. just leave a few dollars in the first week and some in second. there is also no need to tip bar staff for stronger drinks, they were strong enough and tips were not expected. the staff were lively, freindly and wanted to make sure you had a good time.went on two trips - one to saona beach - recomended - catamaran, beach, lunch, dancing, speed boat and swimming with star fish. the other was a jeep safari to take it the dominican in its natural state. theres no piont going to a country if you not gonna bother exploring it! the dominican tour guides were good fun too.most upset tummys were due to the coconut oil that food is cooked in, not under cooking and the fact that most people drank pina coladas all day and night doesnt help. i didnt have any problems. my partner and freinds had few occasions but nothing severe. just a case of adjusting to different eating habits.the entertainment was good too. im glad to say there wasnt many children there either. and you could always get snacks at the end of the night, chips, pitza, hot dogs etc. although i would recomend the beach paella and bbq as they were delicious and try out the local dishes- no piont being in another country if you wanna eat like you do at home.all in all a great trip. would suit couples especially.","date":"2013-03-20 18:04:32 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":5,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}},{"author":"Laurine Dare","content":"Not what I expected Just came back from D.R. and boy was I disapointed. This is one island that I will never go back to. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the hotel. It was the weather and travel aspects, that were a nightmare. When you arrive at the airport, in Punta Cana, it's like stepping back in time. All the money that this country makes off of tourisim and this is the best they can do? The people that live there should be embarrassed. It is not only extremely hot and humid, but dirty and decrepited. Then comes the ride to the resorts. Not only are the roads in terrible condition, there is NOTHING to look at. It's like landing in the middle of the jungle. As far as the Iberostar property, I would give it a 2 to 3 star rating. They people there do try there best and the landscape and beach is nice. We were unfortunate to have rain EVERY DAY that we were there, so there really wasn't anything to do. One major problem we encountered though, was communicating with the staff. English was not spoken or understood very well, throughout the resort. My final opinion, is that I will leave the D.R. to the Europeans.

I went to the Riu Bambu with a friend and had the time of my life. I read alot of these reviews before going and certainly went trying to keep an open mind. I am not a world traveler by any means BUT that does not mean that I do not know a good thing when I see it. I was greeted at the resort with a cocktail, they brought my bags directly to the room and checkin was a breeze!The rooms were beautiful and very clean. The booze in the room was a great extra. I must also add that my friend called the day before we arrived and requested that our rooms be as close as possible and close to the beach. They gave us rooms across the hall from one another and the closest building to the beach!One night I heard some sort of alarm going off from another room and when I called to inquire, someone was at my door minutes after hanging up.Unlike others on here, I thoroughly enjoyed the the nightly entertainment. I watched the entertainment team rehearse each afternoon and then made sure I went to each show in the evening. I found it a great way to end my day. From 'Sexy Belly' to ' Baby Face' to Evelyn, they were all amazing.As for the food, I never had any stomach issues and ate at all of the restaurants. The selection was wonderful and very tasty. I think those that do complain may have set their expectations too high or are just picky!The resort itself was very clean, service top notch and never felt as though they treated one nationality better than the rest. I found that if you were polite to them, they were the same back. Never noticed anything different from Canadians to Americans...etc. The beach was amazing and always tidy. The pool was the same and always some games happening somewhere.I am very much looking forward to going back and having another week of fun. I was thrilled at how nice the resort was and how nice the staff were.

My family and I got back from the RIU Bambu in the DR about 2 weeks ago (7-18 Aug in the DR and Bambu) and just now getting the time to write this review. I have been in the Army now for over 20 years and have been stationed all over the US and Germany. I have even done a couple of tours in Iraq. I mention this only give a frame of reference of where I am coming from. I have no idea about the people who did not have a great vacation. My family and I completely loved every minute of it. I did a pretty good job of looking at all the reviews before we booked the trip and for every 10 reviews there was about 1 negative one. After we booked the trip I started seeing several more bad reviews. This had me a bit worried. But I figured it must have been some very picky people. I saw the reviews about the rock hard beds and flat pillows. I had no problems with the bed or the pillows. They were fine. The room was a bit small but then again we were not in the room very much anyway.  I would like to talk about the good things at the Bambu and then I only have one comment for them to improve on. First the good things: The in room mini bar!! The mini bar in the room was great. I perfect touch when sitting on the balcony relaxing or waiting your turn for the shower. They come and refill the mini bar daily so you are never without your favorite drink. Next was the weather. Just incredible! Temps in the upper 80鈥檚 to mid 90鈥檚 the entire time. Just wonderful. The beach was one of the best I have ever seen. We have been to Hawaii, Spain, Cancun, Portugal, Tunisia and a few other all inclusive places. All seem to have there own charm but I can honestly say, that the beach was awesome at the Bambu. The ocean was just as nice. The pretty blue colors of the ocean were amazing to look at. The pure white sand was also just amazing. I really cannot think of anything negative about it.  Next I want to talk about the hotel staff. Again an area that I was a bit worried about. I read some reviews that said if you did not speak Spanish you were not waited on or not helped. Not true at all. I would say about 90% of the Hotel staff spoke English. In fact about 90% of the staff spoke 3-4 languages fluently. The staff was very friendly and always went out of their way to make you happy. They do work very hard and have long hours but I never saw any one of them complain. The staff also had some very nice shows in the evenings and there was always putting on things to do during the day. I thought the staff was very professional and you could tell they loved their job.  The hotel had several day trips for you to book. We decided to do two of them. Both were great and we had an awesome time. The Sanoma Island trip and the Party boat were both well worth it. I highly recommend either one. The food at the Bambu was perfect. Some reviews talked about the same thing being served over and over again. That was true to a point. Most nights there were things that they had the night before, but they also had many other items to chose from. Most nights there was a theme night. For example a Spanish night where there were lots of tacos, ect鈥?Even the nights were they had the same thing as the previous night, it was not bad at all. There was so much to choose from you did not have the same thing each night if you did not want to.  Ok now for the only area I was not happy with. The cleanliness of the pool was not the best. I thought for a nice hotel it was pretty bad actually. It did not stop me from swimming in the pool daily, but it really needed to be cleaned out. I think if they hire a 鈥減ool cleaner person鈥?who walked around 3-4 times a day to get the stuff that fell into the pool out it would have been much nicer. The pool itself was nice and again I was in it daily but at times it needed someone to get the floating stuff out. The pool bar however was great. The pool bar staff worked hard but always had a big smile on their face and every time I swam up to get a drink they would immediately have one for me. I liked the way they remembered what I was drinking and what my 10 year old daughter was drinking. I gave a few tips (dollars here and there) but I think they would have been just as nice even if I did not.  The last thing I want to bring up was how friendly the other guests staying there were. On my first day we meet a wonderful family from England (Gary, Linn Jess and Katie). It turned out that he had a daughter Jessica who was one year older than my daughter and Katie who was one year younger. They turned out to be good friends and played together as much as they could. It was great meeting them and we are still emailing back and forth. Hope to run into them again in a few years! Ok I think I have rambled on enough. After discussing it over with my wife, we had no trouble deciding this was one of the best vacations we have even been on. We plan on going back in the near future. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great time","date":"2014-03-29 04:08:05 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":3,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Daniella Casper","content":"Amazing beach! We just returned from a week at the RIU Bambu. I had read the negative reviews, but was optimistic anyways. The hotel is not bad, but is certainly not a 5 star. The lobby is beautiful, but the rooms are small, standard, and in need of renovating (hole in the tub). Very clean and great water pressure though. Mini bar with pop and beer, but the only water was in a gallon jug, no indivual bottles, which was disappointing. The air conditioning worked poorly, and a main factor in my disappointment was your room is the ONLY place in the hotel with air conditioning. Be prepared to be hot and sticky at dinner; less than enjoyable. Didn't even want the have a coctail at the bar after dinner or watch the entertainment since it was so hot and uncomfortable. Pool area crowded and could be cleaner, water way too warm. Beach area fantastic!! Plenty of chairs and your choice of sun or shade. Entertainment throughout the day is fun, your choice to join in or not. Service not the best. We brought plenty of money for tipping, but rarely received the service to give a tip. Drinks are great!

I just don't understand how some of the reviews can be so very negative. Just so you know something about us - I travel in the States extensively for work (Federal Gov't), so I don't get to stay in hotels that are considered, by vacation standards, to be be more than 2-3 star hotels, we both ride motorcycles and love to fish. I love to read, love the tropics and beaches. My only request when traveling is that I have a clean room and clean sheets on my bed. My husband hunts and plays golf but not much of a travel-type person; therefore, tends to be a bit more high maintenance when we do travel together. We both were very pleased with our stay at Riu Bambu. We stayed in Building 3 in Rm 312, second floor - very close to everyting and located on the left side of the resort (looking in from the beach). We had an issue with the air conditioning not working, called front office and within minutes, literally, it was repaired and we had more air than we needed. One afternoon the hot water wasn't working. A pipe had broken and the whole building was without hot water. We called, they came, we went to the beach. By the time we came back they had already exposed and repaired the pipe and hot water was working - this took less than 3 hours. By the time we came back from dinner, same day, the hole was filled in and plants were replanted and you couldn't tell anything had ever happened. - alot quicker than we are having the water pipes fixed from recent storms here in Maryland (USA) (two days and counting)!!!! This is not a new resort and things can break down; however, never was an issue and definitely did not affect our vacation. This resort is absolutely beautiful, spaceous, and the location is the best on the beach. I have seen most of the Caribbean and this beach was the most unique in that it had a forest of palm trees right on the beach. The beach was very wide and there was plenty of open sunny places on the beach as well (for all us sun worshippers). Never had a problem with finding chairs. Everything was very clean and never had a problem with cleanliness in the room or anywhere else. The food was good for us as we are not picky and only there for 5 days. We did not get sick, which was my greatest concern since we both like to take advantage of eating different foods and drinking all the specialty drinks. Took a Pepto Bismal chewable tablet every morning and started taking acidophylis two weeks prior to trip and during. Doctor prescribed cipro (antibiotic), just in case, but didn't need it.The beds were a bit hard, but oddly enough, neither of us minded it. We took snacks for the room but never ate them, as we weren't in the room long enough to need them. We even took some small battery operated fans to cool off on the beach - what were we thinking?! - the breeze was constant and perfect on the beach.Took our own towels but never unpacked them. Never a problem with towel thieves.Left tips everywhere we went because that's what we do, but didn't notice that anyone was treated differently - service with a smile and Hola for everyone - and we did notice more people did not leave tips than did - too bad.My only regret on this trip was that it was way too short. We will definitely go back to the Riu Bambu and, for the life of me, I don't get the bad reviews!!!","date":"2015-08-10 01:40:38 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Cecile Legros","content":"Two thumbs down for the Riu Bambu - Beds...Harder then a slab of concrete and the mattress had a ton of nasty stains all over it.

Just back from Riu Bambu. April 12-19- fantastic time!Our first time to Punta Cana and just loved it. Apple Vacations charter with Ryan Airlines out of Boston, direct to Punta Cana. A very relaxing week, we did no excursions.I must say, I don鈥檛 know where some of the complaints that I鈥檝e read about are coming from. They must be extremely picky and unhappy people. We could find no fault.FLIGHT: Flight was delayed an hour coming and going, which was annoying, but other than that, no complaints. Movie shown during the flight, had to purchase headphones for $5 unless you had the foresight to bring your own. They sold sandwiches for $5 each, also, complimentary beverages and some chips. AIRPORT: Departed plane on the tarmac, which was a treat, stepping out into balmy air. For some reason, they held us on the ground for awhile before allowing us to proceed into the terminal. We paid out arrival fee of $10 per person, found our baggage and apple rep fairly quickly, and were on our way to the Riu Bambu at 10:30 pm. The driver dropped us off first. RESORT\/ROOM: Check it was quick, they assigned us Bldg 28, which was fine. I鈥檇 emailed requesting Bldg. 25, but as it was close enough, didn鈥檛 say anything, as they had the papers all made out in advance. We were quite happy with our room, a very short walk, and it was very clean and all you need. There was a crack in the wall up near the ceiling, but heard from someone who stayed at a better resort, that their wall had cracks too. Overall, it was very comfortable, the beds were firm, but we got used to them. We were very glad we鈥檇 brought our pillows, as suggested. I don鈥檛 know what the complaints were about regarding the bedding. I thought the sheets and bedspread were fine, and of a perfect weight for the air conditioning. . Bedspreads could do with updating to a pretty floral, perhaps, instead of the rather dull blue. The only other preference would have been for a bureau instead of the desk with 6 small drawers, but after hanging as much as we could, we had plenty of room. Bath towels were plentiful and nice and thick, as were the pool towels. LAYOUT OF RESORT: We absolutely loved the smallness and layout of the resort. It was such a short walk from room to lobby and on the the pools and beach. We explored all of the adjacent RIU鈥檚 as well as the Iberostar, and despite the grandness of some of the others, would prefer to return here because of the size. DINING: We never did get to try one of the ala cartes. One day the Steak house was available, but not till 9pm, so we decided to stick with the buffets, which were fine. Food was good- some nights great, and you could always find something you liked to eat. Breakfast was our favorite with omelettes to order and yummy croissants, pancakes and French toast were wonderful also. I was disappointed in the desserts. They looked beautiful, but all tasted the same, rather bland. We ate lunch at Mamajuanas after the first day. POOLS; The only thing I wish they鈥檇 had was a 鈥渜uiet pool鈥?for adults. The children鈥檚 pool was right next to the main pool, and the towel game was on in full force. But since we preferred quiet, we stayed under the palms on the beach. I was surprised at some women going topless around the children鈥檚 pool. I thought that was supposed to be reserved for the beach, but people just don鈥檛 care!BEACH: The beach was spectacular, and after walking the beach all the way to the beach markets, feel ours was the biggest and best, even over the larger hotels. Plenty of sun loungers available. We spent all our time there, a short walk to the bar.BARS: Bars were great- always cheerful and accommodating in whatever you wanted. SHOPPING; We walked up the beach vendors one day, and were a bit disappointed. After hearing from everyone, including our Apple rep to offer a third of what they quote, we found that they would not even take $5 for a tshirt- they quoted $10, which is what the gift shops in the resort were asking, so bought them there instead. I did get a set of Larimar necklace, earrings, bracelet for $25. He started out asking $65. Bought one of the small paintings at the resort with the Taino symbols on it for $10. STAFF: We found all the staff very friendly and helpful. Some didn鈥檛 speak any English at all, which wasn鈥檛 a problem until I was trying to ask the masseuse if she could shut the hut鈥檚 door for privacy. I finally gave up, figuring to just let it go- there was much more being exposed on the beach than what might be glimpsed of me getting the massage! Animation staff was wonderful- always something going on, but if you didn鈥檛 want to participate, they left you alone. DEPARTURE: Quickly went through checkin and security with no problems as mentioned on previous posts regarding luggage weight or going through bags. They didn鈥檛 even have us remove our shoes, and never looked in a thing. Again, they walked us out on the tarmac to board, holding us up at one point for a while again, for some unknown reason, and then boarding from both front and rear of plane.

For all of you out there who are worrying about all the negative comments, IGNORE THEM! The Riu Bambu is amazing, just like any other Riu hotel because the chain is fantastic. My mom and I are actually travelling to Riu Vallarta next week which is in Puerto Vallarta. We have been to many Riu's, such as this one, Riu Palace in Cabo San Lucas, as well as Riu Cancun (the name says it all).Food, ENTERTAINMENT (#1), Beach, Service..its all amazing!If you want good entertainment, go to the Riu Bambu in Domenican and NO WHERE ELSE! EVeryone else from the Palaces would be at the Bambu at night getting the best entertainment!Overall, the RIu Bambu is amazing and we were going to return this year but we are going to try something new!

This was done right away and worked for a few days, but needed to be re-sprayed and there were always a few around. Beds very firm, pillows very thin and hard. Bathroom water pressure fine, but rust around tub. Food 鈥?Well, the hot food was hot, the cold food was cold. Not much variety from day to day. Yes a few dishes were different every day, but was very repetitious. Having said that, you could always find something to eat. A la Cartes 鈥?the Caribe Grill is fantastic, but you have to be in the lobby to line up to book by about 6:50 a.m. Steakhouse 鈥?so so.Bars\/seating areas - very crowded, not enough room for everyone. On a popular show night, we sat at the table by 6:30 p.m., then ate our meals in shifts so we could save our spot. Otherwise by showtime there was absolutely no place to sit.Front desk staff 鈥?Friendly, English not a problem while I was there. On one occasion we needed to call our Sunquest Rep and asked to use the desk phone. We were asked to pay for the $2.00 connection fee. When this came up while talking with our Sunquest Rep, we shouldn鈥檛 have had to pay. The clerk was probably pocketing the money.

We emailed ahead and asked for a high floor quiet room ( fear of 8 legged creepy crawlies  light sleeper) So well done Bambu, block 33 best sleep ever on all hols in last 8yrs!! Flight was very good Thomson new roomier planes food was ok films etc good. A little tight with the baggage allowance worth paying for the extra 5 kilos. Transfer was quick efficient and the roads have improved since my last visit in March 07. Arrival and check-in smooth and only a 20min wait for the bags so on the beach in less than 90 mins from landing must be a record for me!! Mark the rep was simply the best knowledgeable, interesting, knew what he was doing, great personality and 100% dedicated to the job nothing was to much trouble for him.The room was filled with towel swans and flowers everyday by a sweet 18yr old who earned $200 per month for a 10 hour day so I suggest if you are going to tip the the girls deserve it, The bar staff make a packet from the Americans who think its fine to give $1 everytime they get a round in and leave the rest of us to fight to get their attention!! The tourists, when we arrived from Manchester (Mondays, Gatwick Thursdays) there were about 200 of us Brits. Ok I know what you are all going to say but Please, Please, Please! Is there anywhere on the Planet that the GERMANS don't go on holiday so the rest of us can be free of their bad mannered, chain smoking arrogance. The problem with this hotel is it's Hamburg with tropical beach. We found out why, on carribean street situated between the Riu Maccao and the Taino is a TUI office which serves the Europeans in the resort now they do speak English and on asking the if they could book us a holiday direct with them this is what we were told, they only book holidays for Main land Europe and if we chose to go say to Paris and book there that was fine. So she kindly gave us a brochure and price list, some of the travellers were there for 10 weeks all inc. Now our Thomson agents don't do that as it's an arm and a leg but if you did want to go for that length of time it will cost you 5500 Euro for a junior suite at the Punta Cana Princess next door which is much more luxurious, so somewhere along the line us Brits are getting done! The weather was faultless, the food good no dellie belly named brands of alcohol if you want them. Do buy earplugs for the shower as quite a few people with ear infections. Overall a really good holiday. Only suggestion for the Hotel are newer pillows for the beds as old ones are wafer thin and tv's need updating . A new manager has arrived and is keeping all staff on their toes. I'd give this hotel 10\/10 for location to a wide clean beach, 8\/10 for staff and 9\/10 for value for money. Would I go again? Yes.Enjoy your stay.","date":"2013-10-20 20:29:25 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":2,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Value":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.hotelsergul.co.uk","vacancy":false}

We booked a two week vacation to Punta Cana, staying at the Riu Bambu. We chose this hotel as we had stayed in it 5 years prior and had a GREAT time. But since the construction of the Palace Punta Cana, located next door to the Bambu, the Bambu has lost its appeal and pales in comparison. As soon as we checked in, we were forced to move to two different rooms as the air conditioning in the rooms didn't work. The room we finally ended up in did have air conditioning but it was VERY weak. None of the restaurants in the hotel have air conditioning so we would be sweating as we ate dinner.The food at the hotel was very bland and selection was limited. We basically ate pizza and fries everyday. The entertainment at night was enjoyable but where they put on the shows is enclosed but without air conditioning. This made it unbearable to sit through an hour-long show. During the first week of our stay we were given a complimentary dinner at the Palace Punta Cana. After eating there we knew what we had been missing. The palace has beautiful restaurants with great food. All of the buffets and A La Carte restaurants are air conditioned making dinner very comfortable. The pool was amazing, the drinks were much better and had more selection ,and the entertainment shows at night were in an air conditioned theatre. After our experience there we paid the extra money and moved to the Palace Punta Cana for the second week we were there. All in all, you get what you pay for. For us, being there for two weeks, it was DEFINITELY worth it to pay the extra money and eat better food, have better drinks and overall, better service. The Riu Bambu is listed as a 5 star hotel but is far from a five star. I would rate it a 3 1\/2 Star if that.","date":"2015-04-05 00:07:40 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":2,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}},{"author":"Kiana Kuhn","content":"great holiday We have just returned from this hotel after spending a week there. It was a great place to stay, the rooms are very good and are kept very clean. We only encountered a slight problem with our mini bar not being re-stocked every 2 days, however if you spoke to the guys on the mini bar rounds, they would give you all the drinks you needed. We have previously stayed in Riu resort in Peurto Plata, and this resort was very similar in layout and style and the staff equally as entertaining and happy. We found that learning a few basic spanish words went a long way with the staff, but to be honest, there was no real problem with language barriers with bar\/waiting\/reception staff. The food was great, and there was plenty to choose from and Im fussy! The restaurants were also worth a visit with the Caribe grill being the best both for food and its location on the sea front. There was a nice breeze which you didnt have in the steak house and Italian. Do be warned that you may experience what could be termed as  dominican belly but we believe this is down to over-indulgance rather than anything to do with the food!!!!!!!!The alcohol was free flowing and it certainly wasnt watered down as has been suggested, or at least our heads didnt say that after a few late nights! Our main disappointment was the disco, as although it was free to get in, you had to pay for drinks, which we found a bit off putting in an all inclusive resort. We visited once, and to be honest it seems to cater towards the staff and locals, rather than the tourists. The riu resort in the north also had a nightclub and this was completely free so we felt a bit miffed!Overall we would recommend this hotel\/resort as it has everything you need and have found that riu are ahead of other chains when it comes to all inclusive holidays. Dont listen to the moans and groans, its what you make of it and if you want 5 star then book one of the palaces - we werent allowed to use their facilities, but they did look impressive. As one of the other reviews stated, there are few brits at this hotel, and found that the majority of the tourists were from Germany the week we stayed.Off to book the next holiday now!","date":"2015-07-27 22:39:37 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Mike Connelly","content":"Wouldn't go back to the RIU What was good...the staff was friendly and the food was good.What was bad....Went to the disco (which is open to the public), our male friends were approached by prostitutes and a drug dealers that were both persistent. So no more disco.The walls were paper thin and I am a light sleeper so because of the screaming German children at 6:30am, 7am and 7:45am in the echo chamber that is the hallway outside your room, I got less sleep than during a regular workweek. The phone number provided by the agent was disconnected, the only phone number that works rings into the RIU Palace and then you have to ask for Bambu reception then the room number. And sometimes NO one would even answer the phone so I had to make phone calls from my room costing me $80.00 US.The pool bar is good until the kids start jumping around you and splashing everyone while their parents ignore it or are not even around.The activities board is not right and I prefer the resorts that hand out photocopied itineraries because we would constantly have to check the board.Take a watch or some time piece, the maid would turn off the room power every day and the clock would have to be reset.Take big cups...6 oz cups on steaming hot days are worthless.Air conditioner does NOT keep up, room was warm.I have stayed at the Iberostar resort next to the RIU and would book there...at least I got to sleep.","date":"2012-06-26 05:33:18 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":3,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":3,"Overall":2,"Rooms":2,"Service":3,"Value":2}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.jimsguesthouse.co.uk\/","vacancy":false}

When we booked the trip we felt that 5 stars resort would be good enough to get a decent service. But it seems like the number of stars in this particular case was very misleading. I would give it a good 4 stars (3 US).Pros: 1) Very nice beach: a lot of shade, white soft sand, terrific sea bottom, enough beach chairs; 2) very well kept hotel grounds; 3) nice pools: clean and big; 4) big rooms: we had space to move around even with an extra twin bed;5) extra requests were quickly satisfied.Cons:1) kids activities not well supervised: about 30 kids were taken on a trip to the nearby hotel for pizza and movies with only 2 persons staff supervising the trip - since we chaperroned our kids we could see that the staff clearly had no control over the situation, they had no communication devices available, they didn't even count all the kids they took and there were no labels provided to identify children even though it was a multi-hotel event; 2) stained bed linens, room and beach towels: they looked washed but not clean, once we suspected the maid just folded a towel we asked to replace and put it back on the rack since it had dirt at the same very spot as the day before; 3) some staff members were extremely unfriendly: the guy that distributed beach towels tried to sell me his own rule that only 1 towel a day was permitted with no exchanges - I had to go to the reception desk to clarify that it was not true;4) not enough kids activities in the evening: there was nothing besides the disco after 6:00PM;5) some of the evening shows were not appropriate for kids but were not identified so on the advertisement flyer - the girls in one of the shows called Cabaret were dressed and danced in such striptease-like manner that I had to remove my kids from the audience as fast as I could; 5) hot food selection was extremely limited: it felt like the same dishes were cooked every day except for a couple of days when they had some specialties;6) no honor for special room requests placed before the arrival: we placed a request to have 2 either connected or next to each other rooms using 3 different contact options provided - the rooms we got were in the same building, same floor but across a long hallway.The overall impression is that they went too far with their costs cutting initiatives. There was a new manager appointed about 3 months ago and people that have been to the resort before claim that it lost a lot of its touch since their previous trip a year ago.","date":"2015-01-16 08:06:35 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":1,"Location":4,"Overall":2,"Rooms":2,"Service":2,"Value":1}},{"author":"Omari Spinka","content":"FANTASTIC Beaches My husband  I stayed at the Bambu Oct 1-8, 2006.

My husband likes the room cold at night to sleep and they have no blankets, so I froze. Fridge was kept well stocked. Room was VERY clean, which impressed us. Food: From my experience with all-inclusive you do not get the best meals. Great fruit selection and even if you are a picky eater there was something to eat. Breakfast was my favorite.Pool: They have two pools, one was shaped like a doughnut and the other was the large pool with the swim-up bar.

My husband  I just returned from a 3 Night\/4 Day stay at the Riu Bambu (booked by Apple Vacations). We flew out of Newark, NJ to Punta Cana, DR on USA3000 Airlines. The flight out of Newark (on Friday, July 7th) was 2 1\/2 hours late to depart (our pilot became ill, and his replacement had to fly in from Pittsburgh, PA). Once in the air, the flight was smooth  easy (though one of the flight attendants did become ill  had to be assisted by a passenger, an RN). There was no coffee cake. Our arrival in Punta Cana went very smoothly ~ we felt very welcomed. The weather was awesome! We were greeted by an Apple Representative, and boarded a bus to our hotel.  I should say, I do ALL OF the driving at home ~ I am a terrible backseat driver. The bus ride was HORRIBLE ... our (very large) Charter Bus PASSED (that's right, PASSED!) atleast a dozen vehicles on the VERY narrow, VERY crowded road to the hotel. And, the view outside of the bus window is beyond heart wrenching. All you see on that 40 minute ride, is complete poverty. You feel very greedy, being on vacation. The Riu Hotel's (Bambu, Macao  Palace) are all in a walled compound (for safety's sake), next to each other, on the same property. The Bambu is the least attractive, of the three. If they had not dropped us off last, we would not have noticed that. Check-In was very easy, the lobby is beautiful, and we were given some cold Hawaiian Punch in a wine glass, which was very nice. ALL of the hotel staff were very friendly. Our room was (unfortunately) very far away (#2805) and to my dissapointment, we were on the first floor. I specifically requested a BALCONY (with Apple) because of all the reviews I had read here, about mold. Luckily, the room smelled fine (though it was a smoking room ... which was MY FAULT ... I completely forgot to request non-smoking, but it truly smelled fine). I brought a box of Bounce (just in case) and I did use them in the drawers  closets. The room was VERY clean  always bug free. I checked the fridge next ~ it was empty (no gallon of water, no beer, no soda) ... and (within seconds) I put my hand on the wall, and had a hand full of WET PAINT!?! I dialed O to talk to the front desk (though looking back, that was a waste, because I couldn't have communicated) ... there was no answer. My husband found the first hotel worker that he could, and he showed up in minutes with (although warm) a full lot of drinks for the fridge. The room was very cool, the A\/C worked fine ... we froze in our beds the first night. AND, the language barrier IS an issue ... you CAN get by with the basics, but ... you aren't going to pull out your English to Spanish Dictionary and say I put my hand in Wet Paint or I requested a Balcony or I really prefer a Non-Smoking Room ... so you WILL let a lot of things go. WARNING: There was a fence outside of our room, with a barbed wire top ... which we also noticed on most of the businesses we passed on our bus ride the hotel. Which means ... you need to BE ALERT  BE AWARE of your surroundings. We headed out to eat ... Mamajuana's was the only choice, and it was awful. Every bad review you will read on here, about the food, is absolutely 100% true. No matter where you eat, it's bad. I won't rehash it all. Let me just say, REMEMBER the mini market has bottled water, soda, chips, etc. ~ and it's well worth PAYING for! The conversion rate is 32 cents on a dollar. Just tell the cashier you want to pay in US Dollars. My husband spent the 3rd  4th Day of our trip, running from the bathroom to the bed. He is still having issues. And, he DID NOT drink a drop of water. We blame the food. Bring lots of Immodium. The beach was gorgeous, the pool is very nice (I won't lie, as clean as it is, a $@!#% floated by me in the jacuzzi, so I got out). Another issue ... the CONSTANT selling of goods  services is very annoying ... you begin to cringe when you hear someone say Hola ... we were approached, non-stop. The hotel staff will do ANYTHING for a tip (one even offered to carry me, on her back, from the beach to the Massage Hut!) If you go, bring LOTS OF $1's (luggage, maids, bartenders, etc.). Also, another WARNING: there are stray dogs that roam the grounds  the beach, looking for food. They seem OK with people, but do fight with each other (over food) at times. I am afraid of dogs, so they kept me very on edge. We will not go back to Punta Cana, and we will not recommend it to anyone.

I just got back from taking 52 people here (10 families). Stayed April 7-14. I chose this resort after reading every single review on every hotel in Punta Cana! I'm not a travel agent - just someone who likes to vacation with friends so I try to research as much as I can to pick a place where I hope everyone will have a good time. The check-in went smooth but they put our group in the far back of the resort. Some of us went to the manager and moved closer to the beach. We stayed in room 2309 which was on the 2nd floor and had a nice view. No rooms have an oceanview but this room looked onto the palms on the beach. Call the hotel before you get there and request upfront especially if you have small children.The number is found on their website and you will get the front desk. Our room's airconditioning did not work and the air coming out smelled like mold! I had a repair man come out and when he opened the vent in the ceiling some gross smelly water poured out- he could not fix it. We could have moved again but didn't want the hassle- wish we had- I still have a cough and so does my daughter-we're very allergic to mold.Some people in the group who had rooms in the back complained of a bad sewer smell.The beds are absolutely horrible-feels like you're sleeping on a boxspring! Believe me, I'm not one who expects or has to have the best and I understand it is the Dominican Republic but I really dreaded going to bed! Tip the maid when you get there to bring extra blankets for padding- it helped. Bring outlet adapters and boogie boards(if you can check them on plane) waves were fun. It's true that the Riu Bambu has the nicest beach in Punta Cana- palm trees everywhere! Stay on the beach as late as you can - it's beautiful! A man in our group brought his fishing gear and caught a huge Schnook(sp?) right at our resort-he gave it to the kitchen for them to cook.Food was wonderful- pleasantly suprised but didn't like the Carribean Restaurant or the Steak House- found the buffet to have more choices and you can see what your getting. Dominicans are so friendly and seem to like their jobs which is nice to see. I tipped a lot because I think its a nice thing to do but you don't have to- they don't expect it. Our group went on the Manarium Snorkel trip and had fun! You get to swim with Nurse sharks ( they don't have front teeth) that are in a netted area. The kids were scared at first but loved it. Some chose to stay on the boat and relax.The animation team at the bambu love their jobs and make the day a lot of fun with their contests and games, although the children complained that the kids club wasn't fun and the shows for them were boring.They need a better organizer and games coordinator for the kids.Some of us got a litte sick but not too bad.All in all, we had a wonderful time!","date":"2015-02-10 08:59:47 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":-1,"Overall":3,"Rooms":2,"Service":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Bennie Padberg","content":"Oh My God, I love this place!! One of the best parts of this trip was the overall beauty of the grounds, beach, and the Riu itself. This was my first visit to the Dominican Republic, and I was very impressed and miss it already, and I have only been home since 2:30 this morning!My 17 year old daughter, her friend and friend's mom and sister were in the group that travelled together. We were very sad to depart the Punta Cana airport to fly home yesterday afternoon, and had to return to 34 degree temps and snow on the side of the road. This all after a week of sun, 85+ temps, and gorgeous beaches. It has been a very sad day.When we first arrived, the trip from the airport to the resort is rather intimidating, as you get a first hand view of the poverty, and it is VERY sad. It was a real eye opening and educational experience about appreciating some of the things that without knowing we took for granted living in America, prior to the trip. That was probably the biggest negative for me.The staff at the Riu Bambu were outstanding.......The Anamacion staff (entertainment team) were OUT OF THIS WORLD! In particular, Angela, Richard, Oliver, Jesus, Daisy, and all the others whose names I cannot remember right now. Wilkin, in the dining room ( aka Chocolat!), Vidal who made reservations for water sports, and all of the resort staff were very gracious and helpful.Not one day went by that there wasn't a new adventure. My daughter experienced several new nationalities, French, German, Canadian, Spanish, etc...She and her friend and friend's mom, could all speak a little Spanish which is helpful. We were all impressed with the staff's ability, many of them to speak, some, up to 5 languages! Impressive!The rooms were nice, and well cared for....don't drink the tap water, there is bottled water provided for you every day.The grounds were impeccable, and always being attended to....The food venues were amazing, anything and everything available to eat...or to try new foods whenever you wanted, needless to say the short walks on the beach may have lessened the weight gain from the constant source of food over the week!The beaches were more beautiful than I have ever seen. Nice tropical breezes, great sunning area with lots of shade for middle of the day sun, and outstanding people watching! Lots of topless sunbathers, which for myself and the other mom was not a problem, being nurses, however the first time you see it it DOES catch you off guard. WE took the Bavaro Runner excursion. Kevin, the guide and Johnny the driver were excellent, too. It was a 120 mile trip, for $80.00\/person and well worth the money spent.We went inland to a sugar cane plantation, tasted sugar cane, went to a typical Dominican farm house, where they made organic coffee and chocolate. We also went to a cigar factory and saw a cigar being made and learned the history of tobacco raising and cigar production in the DR. Then on to the beach for horse back riding and lunch, then returned to our resort. A very fun day was had by all.The girls and the other mom went parasailing and went out on the paddle boats one day. The paddle boats are included in the cost of the resort, however the parasailing was extra. They had blast on both and parsailing was worht hte cost. They said it was awesome!Take lots of sunscreen and reapply reapply reapply.This vacation was a 9.95 on a scale of 10 and we had more fun than I can describe in this small space!!","date":"2015-04-16 18:21:15 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":4,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}},{"author":"Natalia Morar","content":"Will definitely go back!! This was our first trip to Punta Cana and we loved it...equal to other trips to Mexico\/Carribean or better! Overall the Riu Bambu was great! Excellent friendly staff especially the kids at the pool! Great beach and grounds. Food was above average...always could find something to eat. Our room was clean and very nice. The Carribean Street Night was awesome with the music and parade. It was a short walk on the beach to the market where we shopped and haggled with the locals! Good buys too! A couple complaints...the specialty restaurants only take reservations from 7-10 Am. If you are not an early riser as us you can't get in or get late times only. The rooms have thin towels and the mattresses and pillows are bad too. Also bring wash clothes...not provided. You need to often tell the bartenders to put alcohol in your drinks or you get it without! An insulated cup from home is a must to keep drinks cold while by beach\/pool.

We just got back from a fun week at RIU Bambu. The resort is beautiful, clean and well organized. The rooms are sizable with a mini bar that is stocked every other day with liquor, beer, pop  water and yours to drink as you please. It's a short walk from your room to get around the resort and to the beach. The food is quite good, a little repetitive but they are catering to a variety of tastes  cultures so they're fairly mainstream (we couldn't get a reservation for other restaurants because you need to get there at like 7AM to book it so if a la carte is you thing get in line early!), the Mexican themed night at Colonial was really good. The pools are a little small and a little too shaded compared to other resorts I've stayed in - if you want a lounger, once again, you have to be up mighty early to snag one just go down put your towel on it and it's yours for the day!(which is consistent with every resort I've ever been to!). The bars are great and most of the staff are super friendly (and flirtatious!). The beach is beautiful and breezy which does give the ocean great waves that my kids loved diving into - lots of fun. The kids club was ok, in the brochure it says activities from 9:30am-12 - its not, more like 10:45 to 12, then 3 til 5 is more like 3-4!! which was a little disappointing especially if you're looking for some time to relax away from the kids the odd time. Angela who runs the activities is great with the kids and they do have fun even though it's short. The daily games with the Animacion Team are a good laugh, I recommend you participate - their favourite phrase is I lova ma joba which was funny, they are always so happy and they work LONG hours. Shows in the evening were enjoyable, they had a dance show, a Michael Jackson impersonator - who was excellent! and they did Grease! The staff really appreciate it when you try to speak a bit of Spanish to them not that you have to - most of them speak 3\/4 languages anyway! Overall it was a good vacation - I wouldn't go back because I dont like to go to the same place twice, however I would recommend it as a nice family vacation, I wouldn't choose this resort if I was single and looking for a good place to party! P.S. I should forewarn though that all four of us got quite sick on our last day - not quite sure what it was! However it wouldn't put me off, you can easily get as sick just staying at home and eating locally!!","date":"2012-08-29 06:26:12 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":-1,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Shayna Brekke II","content":"Don't go to the Riu Bambu We came today from Bambu. It was bad. Who rate this resort as a 5 star. I would rate it as 3 star, not more. Problems were everywhere from the first day to the last. Room we got was already occupated, so late at night we open somebody's room, people were scared. After that we were waiting pretty long for the new room. Rooms are were small (it wasn't my biggest concern as we didn't spend much time in the room), and we had not more than 2 towels. Towels were the problem on the beach as well, after the rain they run out of the towels. One day we asked for the extra towels to the room, I thouth that we agreed on 4 towels by the evening, but I was surprised to see this evening 4 BEDS in a small room. This is how they listen to you. There is No bar at the beach, and nobody served the drinks at the beach (5 star???). So I asked for the bottled water - it is not available. Gentlemen in Riu uniform SELL the coconuts at the beach, 1st day -$1, 2nd day - $2 per nut. We didn't check the 3rd day. And special words for the dinning arangements: a la cart restorans are so bad, it is no words to explain. Buffet are closed by 8 pm ( for the first setting), and god forbid you to be late - we stayed without dinner this day. Snack 24 hr. is not true. Hod dogs and burgers are not a snack. My advice - check the other secorts, don't go to Riu.

So, we tried the ala carte restaurants where reservations could only be made between 7am and 10am the day of (very annoying). This food was worse than the buffet food to the point where people were walking out in the midst of their meals. Specifically, the Steak House was horrible. My steak was medium rare and I have never chewed so hard on a piece of steak - it was like beef jerky. And, the restaurant was the regular Mama Juana dining pavilion with a section set aside for Steak House and Mediterrean. Also, I found several insects in my food.- bad drinks - the drinks were all sugar, no alcohol and not very diverse. What bar can't make a mudslide?

We are both 35 and quite well travelled.The other reviews that have been submitted pretty much cover our points so we will try to keep it brief.Travel - We travelled with Thomson. Flight and transfers were really good and we found the Thomson reps to be informative and friendly. Transfer took about 45 mins from airport and the check in at the hotel was quick and well organised. So much so that we were in our room with 10 minutes. Transfer back to airport and return flight also on time and no problems.Rooms - Cleaned immaculatley every day. Fresh towels and bedding on a dialy basis. We requested extra pillows and they were brought to our room within 10 minutes. Air-con worked well and rooms also had a cieling fan. Clean bathrooms and a good selection of toiletries. Mini Bar in room was well stocked and replenished every 2 daysFood - We had read alot of mixed reports on the food so didnt quite know what to expect. We didnt eat alot but this was partly because it was so hot. The main buffet restaurnat was great, lots of choice at breakfast, lunch and dinner. There are theme nights every week such as carribean and mexican and the staff really work hard to make sure everyone has a great night. There are also 3 A La Carte restaurants. The menus were limited but the food and service was first class. The only complaint we would have was that the main restaurnat was very hot at all times and is in desperate need of air-con.Pool - Pools were clean and always well maintained. Larger pool with swim up bar at times did get noisy but if pool games arent your thing then there is a quieter smaller pool.Beach - This really was the highlight of the whole holiday. The beach was stunning. Powdery white sand and clear blue sea. Lots of sunbeds avaliable all day and natural shade if you need it. The beach was really clean and well maintained. Pool and beach towels are avaliable.Entertainment - Lots going on throughout the day from volleyball to darts! But no pressure to get involved if you just want to enjoy a Pina Colanda by the pool. Evening entertainment did seem to revolve around kids such as kids disco and talent competitions. If you dont have kids though there are plently of places to just enjoy a quiet drink.Overall - We had a great holiday and would recommend the Riu Bambu to anyone looking for a relaxing and informal holiday. The weather was fantastic the whole 2 weeks. We did have rain most days but this seemed to be on a evening or late afternoon and wasnt a problem as only lasted 20 minutes. We did find it very humid on an evening but daytimes were really pleasant.Just a few tips:Make sure you take all medication etc with you. We were not ill but did hear of people spending 拢7 on a tube of Savlon in the hotel shop!Swimming with the sharks was a great day out. About 拢40 each and worth every penny.VIP lounge can be booked for 拢13 per person for your wait at Punta Cana airport on return flight. Its great vlaue as all drinks and snacks are included as well as internet terminals and comfortable seating and air con.Sorry, not so brief afterall!","date":"2014-10-26 06:21:30 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":-1,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Mrs. Ramon Cartwright","content":"Was Good Until... ok the riu bambu is a very nice resort. it has a very nice beach with a great part of the ocean. the rooms are very good and are kept clean by the great staff. evry1 there wants to make sure that you have the best vacation possible. That is one thing that i enjoyed about the bambu that the staff are awesome. some late nights the night bar staff would let me go behind the bar and pour some beers and make some drinks for people. the food is not that good. it gets very repititive and there isnt a lot of alternatives. the 24hr snakc bar is a joke! i was expecting to go there at 2am and find something really good to eat. not the case, instead i found 12hr old hot dogs that tasted awful. terrible!! if u r looking to buy some gifts do not buy from caribbean street, instead there are vendors about 20min walk down the beach. these guys can be talked down to less than 60-75% of their asking price. however, i urge you not to buy cigars from them or anyone else in the resort. only buy from a government run store in town. now then, your all probably wondering if it sounds so good why is he writing only a neutral report. here it is...i dont know how but i got the most sick i have been in years. my symptons were headache, fever (103), extreme sore throat, and vomiting. i never drank any of the unpurified water so it leaves me to believe its from the food. and if its from the food how are you supposed to protect yourself??...not eat? honestly it was the worst ive been sick since i can remember and i wouldnt wish that on anyone, especially someone on vacation. oh and if yer a single guy goin with buddies, do yourself a favour go somewhere else, theres no single girls here. it consists of couples mostly all european. i find that spanish people from spain are incredibly rude to the point where i almost ended his vacation! ok well beware and thank you.Steve","date":"2014-06-25 03:47:33 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":3,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/londonhotels.jurysinns.com\/jurysinn_chelsea","vacancy":true}

There really is something for everyone here whether you have children or if you are just a couple you will not be disapointed, the staff are wonderful particularly the Animacion team they work so hard and as they keep telling you they really do Love their job The team come around and get you up joining in with activities all through the day but if you are not interested they will not pressure you into doing these. They have many things such as Beach Volleyball and Soccer, Table Tennis, Darts, Water Polo, Aerobics, water aerobics and even dance lessons ! - Cappucino, Oliver and Richard were our favourites but all of these guys make you feel welcome and help break up the tediousness of a long day sunbathing.There is lots of things to do in the resort but the Bambu is the best hotel and because of this you do get people coming from the Palace to hang around you but this should be taken as a compliment as the palace is supposedly better. After ivsiting the Palace we found it to look more asthetically pleasing but there was no atmosphere at all around the pool and felt like people looked down on you if you didn't have a white band on your wrist ! You are much better off staying around the Bambu, day times as well as evenings as the entertainment is much more fun. We all found the food to be of a good standard and with each evening in the main restaurant havung a different theme to it meant that you had a wide variety and you weren't stuck with the same choices each night. The other places to eat near by were also good, in Mama Jawana's you can either go for the Steak House or Mediteranean which is split into 2 halves. These are both 5 courses and are nice but we found that once was enough even though the service is great there was not as much variety of choice. There is also the Caribe Grill restaurant which is on stilts and overlooks the sea, we found this to be the least appealing of the 3 as the staff were not as good and neither was the food but it was a nice change over 2 weeks.The only problem with these 3 is that you have to really book them at 7am in the restaurant because they are limited with space, the Cribe Grill only has a few spaces as the majority have been reserved for the Palace guests and as we found out 1 day, trying to book it at 8.45 am was too late !Many people will be happy with the restaurant but a word of warning for non smokers is that this is allowed in about half the room but this is not seperated from non smoking so if you are near by then it may put you off your food. Only 1 of us became ill in the 2 weeks but whether the food was to blame we do not know, it was all well cooked and fresh, due to a pregnancy we checked that the salad etc were washed with bottled water and were told yes and the ice cubes were not tap water so we were happy. The pool area is well kept and clean and there are plenty of loungers to choose from ( some people reserve these early in the morning or even late at night even if you are not supposed to ) There are plenty of places on the beach and this is vast meaning you don't have to be close to anyone if you don't want to which is great if you just want to sleep in the shade. There are lots of free things to do at the Scuba Caribe places but they will always try to sell you the Scuba Diving and Parasailing rather than you do a free activity such as Kayaking, Snorkelling and Catamaraning ( also if you do want these free ones they tend to be no where near as friendly or heplful and they do not allow these in even slightly choppy water. )There were plenty of bar staff on all the bars so we never waited more than a couple of minutes and they are all friendly and recognised you instantly after the first night. The cocktails are very nice and they make so many that there is no waiting around for them. The beer is very good and the soft drinks all are slef service along with popcorn and peanuts so that saves time anyway.The rooms were very clean and spacious with plenty of clean towels brought daily along with a few toiletries to keep you going. We didn't see any cockroaches or bugs in the room and the air conditioning was so good that we nearly asked for a blanket at reception !! The maid came daily to make beds and tidy up and we found nothing to be taken. The mini bar was stocked every other day and we found this to be enough.The grounds were very well looked after by the gardeners who do a freat job and the public toilets were cleaned round the clock.* Please be carefull of the steps leading up and down from the poolside to the bar as these are deadly - we saw one man slip down them with a glass in hand from the bar and was badly cut as he landed on it. * The reception floor can be slippy when it rains again we saw many people lose their footing.* They do many activities in the main pool and around 5pm these usually involve physical activity, they do move people out of the way but unfortunately one accident happened and a lady was landed on by a man falling off an upturned boat and she had a neck brace on for her whole holiday - Not nice so be wary of children around this time in the main pool area.Overall - great place, Excellent staff and Lovely Facilities but you will hear the same 5 or 6 songs played about 300 times during your stay !!!!Richard and Friends x","date":"2014-07-31 01:29:55 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":-1,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.la-reservehotel.co.uk\/","vacancy":false}

There were no roaches in our room or the hall way. The food was good and plentiful. We were never sick and ate pretty much everything. The only complaint I have is about the entertainment. I recognise that the team work very hard long hours however the shows are quite repetative, at times quite unprofessional and when it is raining no additional entertainment was provided and as a result spent more time watching TV on this holiday than any other. Staff were very helpful and friendly. There are very little shops so dont worry about excess baggage on return journey as theres nothing to buy.Manarium is the excursion where you swim with sharks and rays and was excellent value. Took a trip on a helicopter which was a great way to see the coast line. Without a doubt the best thing about this holiday was the beach. Just as well as this is pretty much all there is in this area. It is huge with white sand and clear blue sea. We never had a problem getting a lounger and there was plenty of space, infact even when the sun shone the beach never looked crowded.A great value for money relaxing beach holiday best suited to couples and famalies. We may return but at a different time of year.","date":"2015-12-02 13:43:50 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":4,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}},{"author":"Conrad Daugherty","content":"unfriendly staff hotel is beautifull and food is pretty good, but staff was not very friendly.","date":"2013-01-16 06:50:01 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":-1,"Overall":2,"Rooms":5,"Service":2,"Value":3}},{"author":"Darby Willms","content":"Fun Place BUT....

Just got back from the Riu Bambu ( feb. 21 - 28 ) The food was really BAD and the wine well impossible to drink. I did book last minute and that was the only place available (not a good sign). Rooms are okay nothing special and mine came with an upgrade I guess; I had hundreds of tiny ants. Since I was travelling alone, I did not mind them and by the end of the week they were gone. Maybe they didn't like my music. Did I tell you how bad the food was? Don't understand how this place got a 5 star rating. I read reviews were some people liked the food. Man you guys need to go out more. Also tons of children and sadly most of them orphans or the parents spend the day at the bar trying to forget they had kids.If you like chatting with other guests, I suggest you bring a German translator. Food is really bad except for soups, deserts and the fries were okay. So for my main course I had a banana and fries. On a more positive note, I was not sick; then again it's pretty hard to get sick on BANANAS. Everyday the buffet is the same; I guess they were afraid to change a good thing. It was nice to come home to a good bottle of Shiraz and week old leftover in my fridge. (DELICACY)Conclusion; If you can survive on very little food, then this is the place. The weather was nice and the beach is beautiful. Good news from my doctor this morning; He thinks I will make a full recovery. PS In case I forgot, the food is really bad.

Beaches were gourgeous! Thought the rooms were nice! Entertainment tried hard but was basically lame! Four males went basically to relax and get some sun. The bus ride from the resort was long and methodical hitting every resort on the way until finally reaching our destination. This was the same returning to the airport after the stay. All of us were sick at different times during our week stay. We all couldn't pin-point exactly what we got sick on, but the common consensus was the food. Two believed it were eggs they ate! We enjoyed the pool bar alot. The resort itself looked like the nicest one in amongst the Riu area except perhaps the Palace resort. However the Palace resort looked as though it may have not been as much fun. In socializing throughout the resort we found that the majority of the people that were there at some point were laid up with illness. It's hard to enjoy yourself after becomming ill with concerns of bad food or perhaps the possibility of dirty glasses for liquer. What happens is you try to find reasons for your illness and it ends up ruining your fun. We are big beer drinkers and found the the beer that they were offering to be awful. Five star resort, please. I shook my head after every sip I took. I'm told the better beer in the Dominican is called Presidente but that was not what they were serving. Overall, after working all year and finding time to take a well deserved vacation this would not be high on my list of return destinations. Sorry, but don't want to hurry back to a place that that was not as good as it was advertised. The Tequila in the Mayan was a better choice. The beaches weren't as nice but the resort was better.

We had a great time! Vacations are what you make of it. When you go to a foreign country, do not expect the same culture\/food\/luxuries that you would get at home. I am surprised at some of the reviews here, very surprised. If you were a Philadelphia native  went to California, would you complain that you could not find a Cheesesteak there? No. Accept the fact that each county is different. The food is different, the service is different. We are very spoiled here.Beaches were incredible. We walked up  down, found the beach at the Bambu the best, very lush  tropical.Rooms were fine, we had everything we needed. Had to borrow a converter for my hairdryer, no big deal. The outlets were very odd, so either borrow a hairdryer from the desk or a converter. Refreshments were refilled every other day. Rooms were cleaned every single day. We did leave the maid little gifts, she took great care of us.We stayed in block 21, it was very, very quiet, with an upstairs balcony.Food - we did not starve, there was food 24\/7. I did get a little bored at breakfast, but I usually only eat a yougurt.There were so many choices. There was Mexican night, Caribbean night. We ate at both the StreakHouse  the Medittranean. They were both excellent. My husband ate goat one evening, he said it was tasty! There is an endless supply of American food: fries, pizza, hamburgers, hotdogs, etc. You will never be hungry.You can make your dinner reservations in the moring for that day. Go early. There is plenty of drinking water available, do not drink the tap water.Animation\/Entertainment - Get involved! That is the way to have fun! They leave you alone if you want peace, but it is more fun to participate.The shows at night were cheesy, but we had a good laugh about it.Pool - Very good, large swim-up bar, jacuzzi we had fun there, the water games were hysterical. Beach - Oh my, the most excellent beach I have ever seen. It is hard to believe it is the Atlantic Ocean, it is so beautiful. We sat there for hours reading, sleeping. By the way, women walk abound without their top. It is an European thing.Watersports - do it! Take a paddle boat, it is fun. We tried everything.Tours - We did the Outback Safari - So interesting. If you are visiting another country, you should get to know the people  the history. We were so well informed. Jose' was out tour guide, he was very smart and courteous. We toured a coffee plantation, a schhol, a small home and a lovely ranch for lunch. The beach was the best part. I suggest doing that early in your trip, so you will be more understanding of your surroundings  culture.Staff - So friendly, the remember you  give you a handshake  a hug every day. Give the bartenders a $1.00 and they are your friend for life. Even the little towel guy, he was so happy, every single day, standing there in the balzing sun, handing out towels. He deserves respect, we fell in love with him, so sweet.Language - Ok, here was my biggest barrier, thank God my husband speeks Spanish. They speak 4 different languages there: Spanish, German, French, English. English is very hard for them. Study up a little on simple phrases. Know hello, thank you, Good evening, it goes a long way.There are a lot of people visioting from Germany, it is very big to visit this resort. They have thier own Travel Agent in the hotel. They are very friendly. Kids - the staff pays extra special attention to the, We were kicking ourselves that we left ours home. Angela was with them from 10:00 am until 9:00 pm. She was great. Kids were treated as guests. They all seemed to be having fun.Suggestions - *Hit the beach first, pool chairs free up around 3:00.*Bring floats for the ocean.*Bring lots of cash for shopping, small bils for tips. It is an unwritten rule here to tip your maid a 1.00 every day, or leave gifts. Tip your bartender at night, he will make your drinks so powerful. Tip the towel guy at the end of your trip, I tought he was going to cry when we handed him 2.00.*Bring pepto, aspirin  immodium. I have the weakest stomach in the world. For the most part I was ok. Overindulgence will get you every time.*Bring lots of sunscreen, we went through 3 bottles. Have a great tan too.*See your travel agent in the beginning of the week. If you can't find him\/her at the lobby, go to the bookshelf there  finf the tour\/travel company book. Your agent  phone number will be in that book. Call them*Phone cards to not work in the Dominican Republic. don't bother buying one.*Keep your cash safe. Nerver use your Visa\/Check Card or ATM card. Use cash or a secure credit card with fraud protection.*Do not buy the cigars at the hotel  on the beach. They are FAKE. If you want cigars, see your tour\/travel agent. Tell her you want to go to Don Lucas cigars. They pick you up  bring you back for free. My husband said the cigars are excellent. The man in charge there speaks English, they are freindly  you can smoke one for free B4 you buy.*$10.00 per person tourist fee when entering the country from USA. Bring cash for that.*PArty Thursday night on Caribbean street, do not miss that.*Beach BBQ on Saturday - good food, lots of rum punch. Dancing - right abound 11:30 that starts behind the ppol bar on the beach.*Get a massage on the beach. $30.00 for over 30 miuntes. Best relaxing massage you will ever have.Hope this helps, you may email me if you have any questions about RIU BAMBU!","date":"2015-07-28 05:09:30 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":4,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}},{"author":"Isaac Kemmer","content":"Travel Agent's Review !! March 2004 I can highly recommend the Riu Bambu, right from the hotel's facilities, the food, the entertainment, the friendly staff that will do anything to keep you happy, to a very comfortable room. The grounds are spectacular, palms everywhere and very well tendered. The beach is out of this world, and I personally feel the beaches were better than Negril in Jamaica...... If only the wind had not been so strong. A good tip is to take lots of small notes in US$'s. They are great for tips and for using in the shop. They never seemed to have any change. Lastly I would just like to commend the hotel on the effort they go to to put on the Theme evenings (in the restaurant)and barbecues on the beach. Plus the staff were so friendly and accommodating. You really do notice the difference coming back to Gatwick and everyone is so sullen !!! If you are planning a trip to Bavaro, spoil yourself and stay in either the Riu Bambu or the Riu Palace Macao !!! I now have no hesitation in recommending these hotels to my clients.

It did not stop us from enjoying our stay or the food. We did 2 excursions - Jungle Safari and Maranarium. We had heard good things about the Jungle Safari but were not that impressed - it's a long day sitting in the back of a truck. You do get to see more of the country and boogie boarding at the beach at the end of the day was fun. The Maranarium is cool. You can swim with nurse sharks and sting rays and it is just a 1\/2 day trip which is nice. We did feel a bit young at RIU - the average age of guests was probably mid 40's.

We have stayed at a Rui resort before and was not disappointed again this time. The Resort was beautiful and the beaches were wonderful. There were many, many palm trees to sit under for shade. We never had a hard time looking for lounge chairs on the beach. However, it was hard to find chairs by the pool later in the afternoon. The Bambu is one of the nicest out of the whole complex and people from other Rui's tend to migrate there, so it tends to get a little crowded. The service was great and the food at the buffet was really good. We ate at the Steak House one evening and it was really good also. As stated in other reviews, take your own wash cloth. They don't give you any. They have many vendors that come in to sell their wares. If you go to buy anything from the vendors, offer them 1\/3 of what they are asking. They sell a lot of jewelry with a stone called Larimar. You have to watch because some vendors sell fakes. If it's a real stone you can hold a lighter under it and it won't turn brown. If it turns brown, it's plastic. I ask one vendor in the complex if the earrings were real and he took my husband's lighter and showed me. He was real nice about it. If they won't do it, then don't buy from them. The best way to make phone calls to back home is to use a pre-paid phone card. You dial 9 for an outside line and then dial the access code (800-872-2881) to get ATT access. Then you just follow your pre-paid card's directions. The resort will charge you a connection fee of 50 pesos (for each call) which is under $2.00 US money. DON'T use your credit card to call. It costs $20.00 for the first 3 minutes. We had trouble with our phone the first night and our remote for the tv didn't work. One phone call and everything was taken care of right away. We went on the Party Barge excursion and if I had to do it again, I wouldn't go. We snorkled a little and there was a lot of dancing and plenty to drink. I had fun but felt it wasn't worth $54. a piece to go. All in all we had a wonderful time and met some really nice people that we will stay in touch with. The one thing I didn't like, which had nothing to do with the resort, is that unless you go on an excursion you don't get out of the Rui Complex. You can walk down the beach (either way) to a flea market but that's it. We have stayed a couple times in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico and I'm a little spoiled because you can walk or ride downtown to shop\/eat or take the ferry across to Cozemel. We talked to a couple people that was staying at the Rui Palace and they took a taxi in town while in Punta Cana. They stated it was pretty scary. However, while taking the bus through town, we saw tourists on bikes and walking around. I would have enjoyed getting outside the resort area more, however I wouldn't pass up another trip to Punta Cana!","date":"2013-01-10 10:09:24 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":4,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.thevillesbedandbreakfast.co.uk","vacancy":true}

We are aged in our mid twenties and can say we had the most enjoyable amazing trip ever. So I thought I would write a full as review as possible. We flew from London Gatwick Airport with My Travel Airways, which was fine. The flight lasted approximately 9 hours going there and on return only 7 hours 30, due to the tail winds. On arrival at Punta Cana Airport the first thing we noticed was obviously the heat, it was around 4.30 ish yet it was still lovely and hot even at that time. A sort walk across the tarmac took us to the arrivals where as soon as you enter you are photographed with a pretty Dominican lady. Being tired, we both thought that this was a security photo yet when going back to UK in departures all photos were posted up giving you the opportunity to buy one. Needless to say after long flights, most people looked pretty rough! Once through the photo all passengers are required to fill out a tourist card to hand in at immigration where they tear off the top strip. We purchased one before we flew out form the Consulate office in Liverpool and filled it out at home which we are pleased we did as the people who bought one on arrival had a bit of a queue to buy one and then had to fill it out there. Just made our life a little easier that s all. After immigration we thought we were done and heading for the coach yet forgot about baggage and I was one of the unlucky ones who had their bags searched. This was probably the least enjoyable part of the trip as they were rather heavy handed when doing this and I don t even think they were being that thorough when searching anyway. Anyway after this you walk outside where there are porters trying to take your bags to the various coaches as I didn t know what coach to go on my main concern wasn t a porter but finding our tour rep, Thomas Cook, who were all lined up waiting to tick your names. When we got to our coach we were slightly peeved that one chap asked for a tip for taking our bags literally 5 metres. I love tipping but that seemed to take the $@!#% a bit. When on the coach the holiday really started. The driver switched on the music and suddenly the soundtrack to holiday had started! The journey to Riu Bambu for us lasted about 1 hour, as there were other hotels to stop off at first. Can definitely say that Riu Bambu looked the best by far. Arriving at the Bambu was painless and the check in reception staff were instantly friendly and helpful, a trait that was reflected through every member of staff we met during the trip. A porter takes your luggage and you then find your room. One bit of advice here. We were in a room the furthest from the reception, which wasn t a problem and only a couple of minutes walk, yet couldn t find it the first time and in the dark, as it got dark at 6.30, we got lost! Therefore it s a good idea to look at the map they give you first to work out the numbering of rooms go. The room itself was wonderful and completely to our taste and convenience. It was well air conditioned and also had a ceiling fan. The safe was good, yet I couldn t work out how to operate it at first, as the key was tricky to put in yet when you get the knack it s easy. There is a minibar full of beer, sprite, coke tonic water, and four optic dispensers of Rum, Gin, Whisky and Brandy and bottle opener and it was all free hooray! You are also given a very large bottle of water, sealed, that is safe to drink and replaced every two days. We could have done with maybe slightly more but this didn t really affect us that much and I imagine if we had asked the reception they would have kindly obliged. The shower and bath were both easy to use and the bathroom itself was clean and tidy but the light in there didn t do your tan justice as it was quite bright! We found the beds quite hard but didn t care about this at all as we got so tired that we could have slept on anything. The balcony was also nice with chairs and table and also a rack for wet clothing very handy. Bring a hairdryer; there isn t one and also the correct adaptor (USA). The TV in the room worked well and most channels were either American or Spanish. Now comes my big word of advice for parents with children at the resort. In the morning on what was our channel 23, at even 7.30\/8 am we switched on to find hard-core porn playing freely much to our surprise. This didn t bother us but I would definitely have had concerns if we had kids with us and they saw this. This didn t seem to be there all the time, only in the morning before breakfast and I imagine through the night and maybe it is me being a prudish Brit as we don t get this, but I found this so surprising. We loved the food and didn t become ill at all. Breakfast was lovely. There is a huge selection of fruit, mostly tropical, fully cooked selection of fried food, pancakes, doughnuts, rolls, unlimited fruit juices, cereals, toast etc. Really very very nice. Lunch food was probably my favourite time. Again there is a huge selection of food, fried, cooked meats, fish, vegetables, salad bar (didn t use this though as we had heard this was most likely to give you the Belly problems) all to choose from plus lovely puddings and more fruit. Evening meal again was wonderful, I had read reviews that there was not enough choice, I must have been at a different hotel. There seemed to be something for everyone and I am a really picky eater but enjoyed something new every night. The drinks in the restaurant were also good. Fruit juices, fizzy drinks flowed freely and you could help yourself to beer on tap and wine (rose, white and red) though I found the White and bit grim for my liking. The two main swimming pools were lovely and even though I had read that some people found them too small, we didn t notice this at all and there always seemed to be plenty of space for everyone. The Jacuzzi was a lot of fun and there always seemed to be a free bed. Many beds are in the shade and there are also many in the sun so you can take your pick. Sometimes the shade was needed as it got so hot and really easy to burn yourself. The Swim up bar, how I loved this! There are approximately 25 seats around it, and yes the afternoon got crowded but if you keep your eyes open you can usually find a space. Above the bar are the names and ingredients of cocktails stating either alcoholic or non-alcoholic and they were lovely. You could also have other drinks e.g. beer, vodka, coke etc if you fancied. The bar staff were excellent; we made really good friends with Javier who was the most fun bar staff man around. After a tip at the beginning of our holiday he really looked after us, even though he was also great before we tipped him. He even used to shout up to me when I wasn t at the bar to see if we wanted another drink. Ahhh, we miss Javier! The pools were warm and refreshing. The animation staff were so **** hard working. They were constantly from morning till late at night doing their work and doing it very well indeed. There were two girls who seemed to do most of the children s activities during the day, who we called girl A and Girl B (Girl B seemed newer) and the kids seemed to love them both and got involved in face painting, volleyball, football, dancing, etc etc. For the older kids amongst us and adults the animation staff were also great. Water Aerobics was fun for both sexes and they organised darts competitions, dancing, volleyball, etc I won a swimming competition which I was quite proud of! The only thing I would say is that sometimes you felt like you had to hide if you didn t want to do an activity as they were trying to get so many people involved. Yet a straightforward no seemed to do the trick. Before we knew there names we gave them nicknames: Shaggy (guess who he is), The Chunk, Kieron Dyer, Boy C, The Queen (again guess who he or she is!) and Ad Bandy and they were all fun. They seemed to work to soundtrack of music through the day and at times just came to the pool and did a dance. You could never get bored here, whatever age you are. One thing I would say is that if you want a completely quiet holiday this isn t for you as they do use music quite a bit round the pools. We loved it though and wish we had the music at home now to relax and dance to! The beach was stunning and the water crystal clear and warm and safe. There were also enough beds for everyone. We loved the beach so much it was perfect postcard material. One word of advice, it can get a bit breezy and you can forget how strong the sun is and thus burns easily happen if you are not careful, like me! The grounds of the Bambu were amazingly well kept and everywhere looks attractive. We were really impressed with the maintenance, if anything needed doing it was done. Look out for the lizards and tropical birds they are lovely to look at. The evening entertainment was quite cheesy but enjoyable nonetheless. It starts with the kids entertainment which was fun to watch and then comes the dancing with the animation staff if you want to followed by awards given to competition winners from the day, followed by a fun icebreaker and then a show, mixed in with more dancing from the animation staff and laughing at the Queen s outfits! Mix this with unlimited bars and popcorn for all and the cheese didn t bother us at all. With regards to money, from a British point of view, you need to take US dollars with you and you can either buy things in US dollars or get it changed to Peso s in the reception. We barely spent anything though and mainly used our money for tipping and $20 departure tax. We were really sad to leave the Bambu as you can probably tell from my ridiculously long essay but would love to go there again in an instant. I have read reviews of people stating that it shouldn t be 5 star but maybe 4. Well, it might be my age showing and lack of visits to 5 star hotels but this looked the best hotel we saw in the Dominican, as we looked around several others and from our point of view couldn t have been any better and THAT justifies why we give it 5 stars.

We just returned last Wednesday, July 23rd from Riu Bambu in Punta Cana. While I knew before hand that it was not a 5 star hotel, I was told that it is the best Riu hotel in the Riu complex of 5 hotels. That was very true - in fact the guests from the Riu Palace (much more $$) spent more time at our resort than their own due to the fact there was more to do, more shows, etc. at our resort. We had the best time there and have already stayed at a 6 star in Mexico. The Riu does a wonderful job in ensuring your comfort and happiness the whole time you are there. While our room was the furthest from the main lobby, we were persistent and succeeded in moving to the FIRST villa by the lobby by the next morning. That was wonderful! The Scuba Caribe water team were wonderful and their prices were less than Apple Tours tour prices - by enough to cover an additional trip - the Sunset Cruise\/snorkel trip. That was $25.00 per person and the best time we had the whole week!!!!!! We went deep sea fishing - also an awesome time - our boat caught a 40+ lb. yellow fin tuna - which was quite a prize for the team that ran the trip. The horseback riding was not recommended by my husband and other couple (I did not go). Their truck broke down in a bad area (ran out of gas!) and the driver had to leave the people (14 of them) alone to go get gas. Besides that, two horses were uncontrollable and my friends nearly got badly injured. The staff at the swim-up bar were fun and attentive - try the Coco Loco drink (inside a real coconut) - it tasted like chocolate milk! There is a wonderful whirlpool off one side of the pool that is the same temperature as the water so not too hot - and very relaxing. We found it inconvenient that we had to pick the same dinner time each night (and were assigned a table). Some days you were hungry earlier than others! If you are not comfortable bringing your children around topless bathers, beware -they are everywhere! It is not allowed in the pool area, but nobody listens.Tipping was not necessary - especially when trying to switch your room. We paid cash to get a better room and the clerk forgot. Make sure you speak to a manager and get their name (there are different managers day and night).The food was excellent - enough variety to keep us placated until we got home. There was pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs, french fries, seafood, pasta (lots of alfredo which was excellent). Each night they celebrated a different ethnic group with the food - caribbean night, Mexican night, etc.We stopped at the Riu Palace Casino - not big by any means, but nice and cool. Punta Cana was extremely HUMID - but we had beautiful blue skies and sun all 8 days we were there! The coolest place to go is the beach - day or night.The water is green and beautiful - navy blue out further in the sea. Gorgeous resort......The rooms were adequate - not 5 star, perhaps 3 or 4 - but we were seldom in them!Hope you have a great trip! I will return some day!

It is independently thriving with its agricultural and industiral developments. I am unable to convince myself to return however, mostly due to my stay at this hotel in 2003. My son, who was 3 at the time, tripped over a very large rat one evening by the pool after participating in a children's program. The rat was large-probably around 5-8 pounds. Luckily my husband scooped him up as the rat was circling around with a broken leg and he avoided being bitten. There were rats playing around the pool area during the day causing guests to scream occasionally and raise their feet up to their chairs. There were large cockroaches in our room on the ground floor. The pillows smelled of mildew. After the rat episode on the third evening we requested to be moved to a new room on an upper floor. In the second room we did not see any cockroaches-this may have been due to sleeping with all the lights on due to my fear of the rats. The pillows in this room also smelled like mildew. In one restaurant for an evening meal my husband had to use the restroom. There were roaches crawling out of cracks in the walls. The food tasted great and we did not get sick. I just can't help but imagine the roaches and rats walking over the kitchen areas since they were out in public areas. I could not sleep and anticipated the end of our trip. We decided to get a Taxi and go into a small town to shop. A prostitute approached my husband while in a cafe with myself and our 3 year old. A man from a shop attempted to carry off my child in an attempt to get us to follow him to his store (this was not encouraging to get us to buy something). Finally we were riding the shuttle back to the airport and are pulled over by men with machine guns. Apparently we were attempting to return to the airport when government members were arriving for the latin american summit. We have stayed at other Riu properties in Latin America, and the Melao was an entirely different experience. I do realize that the climate is very nice for roaches and rats, but the hotel needs desperately to implement some form of pest control as well as dehumidification system in the rooms. I did not feel safe (especially for my child) for these health reasons as well as the political instability. My husband is a police officer and speaks Spanish fluently and usually we are comfortable traveling about and had looked forward to a trip to the Dominican Republic for quite some time. It is the most unforgetable trip we have ever been on.","date":"2013-02-08 20:36:59 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":1,"Location":-1,"Overall":1,"Rooms":2,"Service":2,"Value":1}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.k-west.co.uk\/","vacancy":true}

I just got back from an amazing week-long vacation at the Riu Palace Macao. A group of 35 went down for my sister's wedding and it was wonderful. It was my first time on an all inclusive vacation. The Dominican people and the resort staff in particular are probably the nicest people I have ever met. They are SO hardworking but go about their work with such a happy attitude. The resort was spotless except for a slight smokey smell in the rooms but that's the same in most hotels. The food was delicious. I'm a vegetarian and I found many options at the buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The a la cart restaurants are better suited to meat-eaters. The ocean was a little weedy because of recent storms but it was so warm and I swam in it more than the pool. I do recommend going off the resort on day trips because 1) it's fun! and 2) to see how the Dominican people live - it's a real eye-opener. If you want to go horseback riding I would think twice about it because the horses are not in the best condition. Overall I highly recommend the Riu Palace. I visited the top of the line 'Palace Punta Cana' and I have to say I much preferred the Macao - it's more intimate and friendly while still a 5-star resort.

We picked this hotel because we had been there In November with another couple. Our first visit was fabulous. None of us could find any thing about which to complain, We had read all the reviews and kind of knew what we were getting., Our second trip in May left a lot to be desired. We had to have our first room changed because it only had a queen bed and we had requested a king size. Neither one of us is tiny!! We were moved the next morning to a room that looked exactly the same as our room in November 2007. However, by the second day we noticed very limited hot water for washing. By the third day we didn't have any hot water (gives new meaning to cold showers). We called the front desk and they said they were taking care of the situation No one (that day or any day after) seemed to think this was a big dea!! To make a long story short, the next time we had hot water was on the last (7th) day of our vacation. Ironically we noted that the only guests that were complaining of the lack of hot water were Americans! Lots and lots of Europeans. The service staff (cleaning, food, etc.) was still very efficient though did not seem to be as large as in the Fall\/Winter, Could be the reason for the downfall in the property,I would not go back to this hotel. Definitely not 4 stars.I must admit though, that after returning home and speaking with my travel agent she did get us a one day refund from Riu.

I was at the resort at 10:30am.Reception: I was handed a lovely drink upon arrival at the front desk. Widney was fast and friendly. I was in my beautiful room at 10:40amRooms: Very clean. Very roomy.

Also, there was evening turn down service for the bed with candies.Food: The buffets were amazing. I never tried the A La Carte restaurants because I heard other guests say they were not that great. The have a Europeon flair to the style of the food--breakfast was amazing, eggs any style, made-to-order omelettes, french toast, pancakes, tons of fresh gourmet cheeses and meats, yogurts, fresh fruits. I had lunch by the pool everyday--that buffet was also amazing. Everything from pizza to pork, chicken, salads, nachos, fruit, desserts. Dinner was the greatest. The service was amazing. Food ranged from caviar, shrimp, pork, beef, chicken, pasta, salads, breads, pizza, etc.Service: I was truly pampered by the amazing staff at the Macao. All employees always had smiles on their faces and always greeted you happily.Casino: Very small, very old broken machines, but I won!!!I plan on returning again in March 2009.

The staff was great, very friendly and engaging. The three restaurants in addition to the main buffet which had a different theme everyday were good. The Japanese restaurant served a great salmon, but you will not get sushi or shimie in any quantity or quality. The other two were Caribbean and a Steak house, which were great. The grounds were flawless and staff would bring you drinks while you laid around by the pool or on the beach (all included, but its nice to tip...hint hint) I would recommend bring $100 in singles and another hundred in $5 for tipping and to carry a few bucks on yourself during the day for those small things like Allovera (for those sun burns.) I would tell anyone to go there. This was my first all inclusive resort, so I don鈥檛 have a basis for comparison, but I could not have asked for anything more while I was there. This place was what I pictured in my head of what an all inclusive resort would be from tv, movies, and books, and then they took it a step further. There is a live show every night from 945 to like 1115 or 1145. The head of entertainment Johnny Bravo is funny, engaging, and puts on a great show.

Check-in was seamless and uneventful-we later learned the resort was booked at about 60-70%. We received an upgraded room simply by asking. The room was clean but dated and the old bedding and mattress were well below par. Food at the buffet for all meals was good and varied. The on-premises restaurants offered little variety and slow service and were rarely filled. We found these restaurants were not worth booking.

I was a little disappointed that our room did not have a king sized bed. It had two fulls pushed together. The sheets did not fit and always seemed to slide off of the mattress. The room was cool enough and we had no problems with the air conditioning. My biggest complaint was the shower. They are very small and the curtain seemed to attack you as you were bathing. Quite disgusting considering that I doubt they clean them often. Another problem that we had was the hot water. It seemed to change temperature five-six times while taking a shower. It was too hot, then too cold, etc. Minibar: Diet pepsi, pepsi, orange soda, mineral water, and a gallon of water...filled occasionally. I am a big diet soda drinker and during the whole week, I pretty much had what I wanted 5\/7 days. They also have four bottles of alcohol attached to the wall so you could make your own drinks but we didn't bother.Roomservice: Don't order the nachos (stale) or the club sandwich, that's all I have to say about that. They were both disgusting!Restaurants: This was my absolute biggest complaint. Breakfast was good. They have typical American fare and some Dominican cuisine. The fresh fruit juice is amazing. The only option available is the buffet and it is the same every day. Lunch was HORRIBLE!!! The only option available yet again is buffet. I don't mind it for breakfast, but it gets annoying around lunchtime. They also have the same thing everyday. This is basically pizza (not bad), fries (OK), burgers (disgusting!!!), hotdogs, fruit, bread, and different types of pasta\/seafood salads. I attempted to make my own salad one day but they really only have lettuce and tomato slices for a salad. The only option for dressing was thousand island. Basically, it stunk. AND, there was only one restaurant open. I absolutely hated lunch and we ended up skipping it.Dinner was good. The buffet has a lot of options for everyone, and we ended up eating there twice, enjoying it both times. They have a pasta station, and different meats. The menu changes slightly every night, which is nice. Steakhouse was good and I was delighted to discover that they actually had Caesar salads that were quite good. My husband and I don't do Japanese and the Italian restaurant only had dishes with cream sauce or seafood (my husband doesn't eat either). Basically, if you are on a diet don't eat here. Everything that I ate was cooked in grease or butter. Be prepared to be hot since men are required to wear pants.Pool: Never hard to find a chair, well maintained, and beautiful. No swim up bar and the bathrooms are a bit of a hike (they are towards the back of the pool bar).Beach: Beautiful. A bit of sea grass but overall it was gorgeous.Bars: Best bar was the main lobby. Drinks are really good. I am not into top shelf liquor, so that didn't bother me. The frozen drinks made up for it and were delicious. They also have salted peanuts as a snack. Try the Mama Juana. It's a Dominican run that is awesome sipped alone. Yovanney is the best bartender.Excursions: Don't do Bavaro splash or the catamarans (three hour bus drive from hotel, they don't tell you that). We attempted to go to a Dominican restaurant called Jellyfish. Paul in the main lobby suggested another restaurant called Langosta Caribe. I said that this was fine with me. After a 20$ cab ride, it was closed. I was NOT happy!!! We ended up paying another $20 to get to Jellyfish, and $20 for the return home. Casino: Very SMALL.Overall, it wasn't bad for the price we paid. I tend to focus on the negative because it's just there. We had a nice time on the vacation and the staff was very nice. I really think Paul made an honest mistake. The worst part for me was the whole 3 buffets a day.

We viewed several of the surrounding hotels, and concluded that Riu Palace Macao had the best mix of luxury and casualty of anyone else.I hope you'll enjoy it as much as we did!Molly and Joel Stroud","date":"2012-11-07 18:15:17 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":4,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.swintonhotel.com\/","vacancy":true}

We just returned from our vacation at the Riu Macao - Punta Cana 30 March-April 6! We had a WONDERFUL time and would go back again! After reading the reviews over the past several months there were times I was seconding guessing our choice and times I couldn't get to Punta Cana fast enough. We booked our vacation throught our travel agentApple Vacations. We flew USA 3000 - great service - the plane was a bit cramped for my husband, but for the kids (14\/12 yrs) and myself we were confortable. Upon arrival at the airport after retrieving your luggage, we were greated by a Apple Representative who directed us to our bus. The bus ride to the hotel is roughly about 35 minutes to the hotel. Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by the front desk with a smile and tropical punch. The room was spotless but did smell a bit at first. No problem - opened the sliders to the balcony and lit some candles that we had brought along with some fabreeze sheets for the closet (a suggestion I got from this site). We never seem to have the smell the rest of the trip - when we were in the room we always had the sliders open. The room was SPOTLESS and we all found the beds  pillows surprising comfortable - many complained the beds were too hard - we like a firm mattress so there was no complaint there. There is something to do for EVERYONE of EVERY AGE. The Activity Directors had plenty of things to do for everyone. ..volleyball, dance lessons, darts, bocce, ping pong, aerobics, etc. You can choose to participate or not. The beach is absolutely BONITO! The pool is also enjoyable ...we NEVER ever had a problem finding a chair at the pool or the beach and we were not down at the break of dawn for reserve a chair for 4. The food is good with the buffet offering the most variety for everyone. Sometimes some of the meat was overcooked, but there is some much to choose from fish, meat, pasta, salad, fruit , cheeses, etc. and service with a smile. Everyone was pleasant ,spoke English and gave us a chance to practice our Spanish! There were visitors from all countries US, Canada, England, Germany, Italy - a nice diversity.Just a hint in regards to water sports and tennis - you need to reserve early (the day before most likely) if you want to make sure you get a sailfish, paddleboat, etc. and court. Excursions we participated in and enjoyed was the Jungle Safari ask for Danny Boy (the guide) he is fabulous (enjoyed the most), The snorkeling\/swimming w\/ nurse sharks\/ray and the Quad tour. Would go back in a heart beat!","date":"2015-04-28 09:17:15 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":3,"Check in \/ front desk":3,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.strand-continental.co.uk\/","vacancy":true}

We have just returned from our one week return trip to the RIU Palace Macao. After numerous visits to this resort we feel that we need to write a detailed review of our most recent experience at the Macao now in the shadows of the new RIU Palace Punta Cana.About us: We are a couple that has traveled extensively over the past 14 years in the Caribbean 2 or 3 times each year. Without a doubt we are true sun and ocean worshippers who seek out incredible beaches with powder white sand and clear Caribbean blue waters. Furthermore we enjoy personalized service, comfortable and well appointed accommodations. My partner being a private retreat chef here in Ontario, we also seek, good quality food that is presented with elegance and artful mastery. After visits to numerous islands and tropical locals we discovered Punta Cana 6 years ago and now view it as our home in paradise. In Punta Cana we have traveled numerous times to the RIU Palace Macao, once to the RIU Bambu and to the Bahia Principe Club Diamond.Planning and Booking: Our trip was planned using the very knowledgeable and professional guidance of Robyn at Itravel2000.com. Through her guidance and efforts we were able to find the best pricing and leaving at a date and time that were accommodating to our pocketbook and schedule. She answered our numerous emails promptly and with concise and accurate information. Who ever said that you did not get personalized treatment with an online travel company has never dealt with Robyn, who we will continue to book our trips with.Departure and Flight with Skyservice: We arrived at the airport within the three hour recommended timeframe and we were able to secure exit seats. I highly recommend attempting to secure these seats when you arrive at the airport (you can not pre-book these seats) as all others are completely unbearable. Our luggage was weighed and we were under weight, so no charge. Be warned baggage over is charged $10 per kilo.The flight was rather uneventful but made entertaining by the bumbling dialogue made by the head Skyservice flight attendant who stumbled through every announcement that she read. The flight was made further entertaining by the in-flight movie, not because the movie was entertaining, but rather by the further bumbling errors of the same flight attendant who first started the film then 1\/5 of the way through after making an error with the sound system for one side the plane, restarted the film, then made an announcement 1\/5 of the way through the movie and could not get the movie restarted so she went back to the beginning. Well if we missed anything in the beginning of the movie, we definitely caught it by the third time we saw it! The in-flight snack was a chicken quesadilla and other little packages of snacks such as cheese and crackers. All of this passes the time and tries to take your mind off the fact that you are cramped and uncomfortable and that most of the way you have someone鈥檚 elbow shoved into your side 鈥?and that is in an exit seat where you have the luxury of a little more room.Arrival at the Dominican Airport: As you walk off the airplane the warmth of the Caribbean night air kisses your face and you know that all of the discomfort on the airplane was definitely worth it. You exit the aircraft and walk towards the airport that is an open air thatched roof building. Get ready to smile as you enter the terminal there are two young ladies there to greet you in traditional Dominican garb who you will have your picture taken with as you pass through the entrance. These photos will be available for sale for $5 US when you leave the island a week or two later. The process to enter the island is smooth, have your passport, and blue Dominican tourist ready and wait in line to have them processed. As you wait you will be soothed by the mariachi musicians playing and the warmth of the Caribbean air. The line moves quickly. Once you have completed this process you collect your luggage and head out into the main lobby of the airport, where you will find a Sunquest rep who will point you towards the Sunquest bus which will take you to your resort. At the bus you will sign in and be given an orientation meeting invitation. At this point sit back on the air-conditioned bus and enjoy the scenery out the window and listen to the Caribbean music played. Arrival at The RIU Palace Macao: Arriving at night the week prior to Christmas we found that the palm trees that line the entranceway to the Macao a glow in hundreds of Christmas lights. The bus arrives and the luggage is taken off (make sure that your bag is taken off as the bus will likely stop at one or more other RIU properties). At reception you are given your tan wristbands, room key, safe key, towel card, and restaurant card along with luggage tags. Reception is warm, welcoming and informative and fluently delivered in English. A attentive bellhop quickly loads your luggage onto a brass luggage cart and shortly delivers your luggage to your room. The Room: We were very impressed with our third floor garden view room. We were pleasantly surprised to find we were given a corner room with three sliding balcony doors and wrap around balcony that forms into a large hexagon appointed with plantation style wooden rockers, cocktail table and drying rack. The room is appointed with two overstuffed comfortable wing chairs, small bistro table, two night stands, a large credenza that houses the mini bar, large closet that comes with approximately 10 hangers, iron and ironing board. The bathroom comes with tub\/shower combination, bidet, well lit mirror, single sink and shaving mirror. The room and bathroom are outfitted with some limited toiletries (bottle of RIU shampoo\/body wash, bar of RIU soap and shower cap.) You will also find a bar wall unit that houses several bottles of liquors including gin, rum gin and tequila I believe. The bar fridge has pop (Pepsi, diet Pepsi, 7Up orange soda, tonic and a large jug of water. You will also find two bottles of Bohemian Beer. Room Service: There is also a room service option for breakfast to 11:00 am and then a snack service including such items as a vegetarian sandwich, a BLT sandwich, Caesar with chicken, nachos and cheese to highlight a few.Orientation: Depending on whether you arrive in the morning or evening the orientation meeting will be held either on the day of arrival or the next morning. We always attend, but this time we wish we had not, the meeting started 20 minutes late and then all that we were told is where to find the Sunquest book that would list our departure time. Other than that the presenter struggled to explain the tours available. That was it! There was no information about the resort or the services provided.Late Night Snacks As we arrived at the resort at 11:00pm the late night snack bar was the only food option. It is located beside the pool. Here you will find a small salad bar and a small buffet serving fried chicken, fries, pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs and beans with rice. Once you are seated a waiter will come along taking drink orders. After two glasses of red wine were informed that they hand run out. Strange, we thought but decided it was because it was late at night and the waiter was on by himself he was unable to go to the main bar to get more. More on this later鈥? Piano Bar: Located next to the lobby across from the main buffet restaurant is the 24hour bar. This room definitely has a plantation feel to it, with dark, wide seated wicker chairs arranged in groupings of four around low cocktail tables. Here you can have drinks into the wee hours of the morning along with wonderful cappuccinos. Each evening you will find a variety of wonderful singers and piano players to entertain you. The last session ends around the time that the Pacha Disco opens (I believe that is 11:30). This is usually a wonderful room to sit back in and relax after spending many hours lounging in the sun.The Showroom: You enter the show room via the piano bar through huge heavy velvet drapes. The art deco d茅cor continues and gives the illusion of entering the showroom of a vintage cruise ship. Most shows are entertaining to watch as you sip an evening cocktail that has been delivered to your table by one of the waiters. The Michael Jackson show (even if you are not a huge fan) should not be missed as well the Cabaret show was extremely well done.The Main Buffet Dining room: The d茅cor here is definitely elegant and continues that art deco feel. During the evening you will find waiters and waitresses dressed in tuxedo shirts, vests, bowties and pants. At lunch the waiters are now dressed in colorful Caribbean flowered shirts and dark pants. Kabuki: The Japanese Restaurant is one of four a la carte restaurants for Macao guest to use. You are presented with a lovely plate of sushi and a menu. Next you are given a choice of several starters, entrees and dessert. We thoroughly enjoyed the Dominican version of sushi, then tempura, a wonderful shrimp stir-fry and then we were brought a tempura ice-cream and fruit to share. The food we found here to be very enjoyable but better than the food was the attentive waiter鈥?he made the evening very relaxing and enjoyable.The food: There is a wide variety of food served at several buffet stations. During the evening there is always a carving station that always has something delectable. The roast duck and pork were quite memorable. At the main buffet area you will find a fish, beef and chicken entr茅e at all three sittings as well as a variety of pastas and other vegetables and starches. There is always an abundance of cheeses and crackers at the cheese buffet, decadent desserts and a wide variety of fresh fruits Even the fussiest eater should be able to find something they find enjoyable. For those that are worried there is always French fries, rice, plain pasta and pizza!Pool and Pool Service: The pool is beautiful with elegant statues and fountains and is wonderful for cooling off in after basking in the sun. While floating in the pool or lounging in the sun, drink service is provided. The service of Jose was very notably attentive and professional. There is an abundance of loungers and a ready supply of fresh towels.The Beach: Breathtaking and endless. The sand is snow white and soft that extends into the ocean. The ocean bottom is clear and soft without being so soft that it feels muddy. There are lots of sun loungers available. People scope out there spots and do place there towels on the loungers and belongings but this is not a problem. As I have stated there are more than enough loungers and the resort was filled to capacity. Furthermore, your belongs are safe on chairs, though I don鈥檛 recommend tempting individuals by leaving cameras on your chair while you go to lunch for an hour but while swimming this would not be an issue. We also left our books and shoes along with our towels beach bag and a couple of $US for tipping wait staff all day and had no problems. I guess the rule of thumb is don鈥檛 leave anything on your chair that if it was taken your trip would ruined by. Departure: The bus picks you up at the resort about three hours earlier than departure and it escorts to the airport and gets you into the correct line. Be sure that your luggage is placed on the bus at the resort before you get on the bus. On our trip home one individual failed to ensure their bag was on the bus and had to leave the country without their belongs which would be sent to them at a later date.Skyservice: The scale mystery. As mentioned earlier, on the way down our bags weighed under the limit. They were loaded with sunscreen, health care products and gifts. All of these things were left on the island. We did not purchase anything and presto our bags were over weight???? First we were 7 kilos over then we were 5 kilos and finally we were 4 kilos over when weighed by the supervisor. First how did the weight keep changing??? The reason explained that our weight went up on our return was that our bathing suits were wet and maybe sand???? 4 kilos added due to 2 wet suits and sand? Something is not right. We are presently in contact with Skyservice.The flight home was miserable. We were not able to get aisle seats and we were crammed into the regular seats. We are average build men, one being 5鈥? and myself 5鈥?1. My knees were shoved into the back of the airplane seat in front of me so badly that I had to remove the aircraft magazines for a little extra room. Impressions of the Macao from someone who has been numerous times before: Seeing the Macao is like visiting a great movie starlet from an era gone by who鈥檚 makeup is starting to crack. If this is your first visit you will be very happy however, if you are a returning visitor you can鈥檛 ignore that nagging feeling that things are not as grand as they use to be. -Management has changed since we were there last and we are not sure if that is a reflection of changing standards.This was another birthday trip and there was not any recognition made by the staff what so ever 鈥?even at the Bambu my partner was presented with a cake and the room was decorated with balloons and a small painting and bottle of room were left as a present. This was disappointing and totally out of character, especially after numerous emails were sent to R Miller in customer service. Furthermore, when checking in the date was left with the front desk. -The selection of food was good but not as extensive nor varied. The Gala Night fizzled in comparison to other Gala鈥檚.-Previously, in the evening you were given one waiter who you became familiar with and who know your likes and dislikes, red dry wine not chilled for example. It was all part of that small intimate resort service that made the Macao stand out. This was not the case on this trip we had a parade of evening waiters and at times you were not even sure who your waiter was. Breakfast service was lacking as well, quite often your dirty dishes were left sitting on your table. These are all areas that the Macao use to pride themselves with 鈥攐utstanding Palace service.-The wine, one of the reasons we did not like the Bambu is the terrible wine that they served. The Palace always recieved a better quality wine than the other RIUs. Well the standard at the Macao has dropped to the same standard if not lower. They have also started to chill the wine to try and mask that it is starting to turn to vinegar. It seems on our first night we received the last two glasses of good red wine. Furthermore, at lunch sometimes your drink order was taken and never was filled.-The shows while entertaining are not of the same quality as in previous years. -The toiletries are not of the same standard and not replenished. Furthermore, sometimes you were given fresh towels in the evening and sometimes you were not. -When we arrived at the Macao we were told that we had exchange privileges with all RIUs but the new palace. We were assured that the Macao and the Palace Punta Cana were of the same status but the palaces remained exclusive. So we thought that made sense both Palaces had no exchange privileges with each other. This was not the case, the new RIU Palace Punta Cana have privileges at all resorts including the Macao. Here is the problem with that during our visit. The Palace Punta Cana had been invaded by a group of about 20 drunken mid twenty year olds who were heavy partiers and neither palace was set up for that BUT the Macao鈥檚 piano bar and casino were right beside their intimate piano bar. This group invaded the piano bar to get their buzz and every time they wanted a drink because the Macao would give them plastic drinking cups filled with alcohol that could be taken to the disco with them this became their evening hangout. It really did destroy the atmosphere. Management was completely aware of the issue of these individuals who even had the gall to go behind the bar to try and pour their own drinks if the bartender was serving someone else. The final straw was as they announced on their last evening that they were going to make themselves our (Macao guests) worst nightmare. I have to say that this did not happen in the previous years at the Macao not because out of hand partiers did not arrive at the Macao but because the management boldly put a stop to it.-The last straw, cockroaches, never had we encountered them at the Macao but we encountered one in our room and one in the dining room. This is just not acceptable for a RIU Palace. Yeas we only saw two but for us that was two too many.It is unfortunate that the Macao is allowing itself to fall this way. We loved the Macao and recommended it to many of our friends and family. My teaching partner was prepared to get married there but is now opting for the Palace Punta Cana instead. We loved the Macao鈥檚 art deco d茅cor, the small intimate setting and the service that could not be surpassed at any other Punta Cana resort. We had planned to return to the Macao in July with family and then for 2 weeks the following March but have decided against that. Instead we are planning to return to the RIU but this time we intend to stay at the new RIU Palace Punta Cana in our opinion it is worth the few hundred dollars more. We are wondering when they will drop the Palace name from the Macao. If you are booked at the Macao you will have a lovely time and be quite happy with the service and the quality of the food, as long as you have not attended another RIU Palace because this is no longer be presented by management as the Palace it use to be.","date":"2012-07-11 08:25:34 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Value":5}},{"author":"Burdette Emmerich","content":"Excellent Vacation and Value My husband and I just returned from the Riu Palace Oct. 16-20, 2006, (punta cana), I must say...we really had a ball. I've read some of the neg reviews about it...but I beg to differ!The shows were nice, some better than others but worth while, it all depends what you're in to. I have a broad mind and am therefore open to new and interesting entertainment, so I must say I really did enjoy the nightlife. I also read what someone wrote about the Casino... In part I agree that the Slots in the Sports Bar are not designed to WIN, in fact I spoke with most people to get there experience and feel for it...No one won a jackpot, or even coins worth cashing in. However, I took the Shuttle on two seperate nights to the casino at Macao and I must tell you I hit the first night on the slots for $75 bucks ($20 investment) and the forth night of my stay I hit for $275 bucks. Oh, and did I mention, I never take more than $25 dollars along to a casino...I'm a cheap skate. The beds were very hard...I like firm but not cardboard!! I'm keeping it real with ya. The housekeeper had to bring in a second storage blanket to place under the sheets. But all in all, it became tolerable. The grounds are kept and very well manicured. I didn't see one Gepco...and I can't begin to tell you my relief as I've stayed at other Punta Cana properties, and my husband thought that I'd come down with a nervous condition...because I became agitated and kept jumpting everytime I'd seen one in the past.The food was great. However, after a couple of days of the same food cooked a different way...can make you tired fast. We did make reservations for two of the specialty restaurants.. (Brazilian and Japanese). The down side is that you have to make reservations between 10am-1pm...if you partied like heck the night before... sometimes can be very discouraging. Don Manuels was fine with me, it was my husband who had a taste for venturing. I did enjoy the Brazilian Restaurant, but the Japanese one left a little to be desired. Not a great menu selection.I love it so much there, that I am going back for my anniversary in March.","date":"2014-07-12 20:04:11 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":5,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}},{"author":"Buford Schinner DVM","content":"WOW!!

The hotel is beautiful with wonderfully maintained grounds that include plenty of tropical foliage. Interestingly, the grounds provide many of the niceties you'll exeperience during your stay. The flowers in your room and the coconuts they serve by the pool are all harvested right from the property. The rooms are very nice and offers small balconies (we got lucky with a corner room that afforded a large balcony). The mini-bar and perpetually re-stocked fridge are a definite plus.The beach is gorgeous. There was a constant breeze that was just enough to keep you cool. For those that want to avoid the sun, there is a large palm grove that has plenty of loungers. Both the beach and the grove are very close to the beach bar which is a great place to meet people from all over the world. There are plenty of activities (volleyball, aerobics, dance lessons) right on the beach and you can also use the hotel's kayaks, snorkeling equipment, and paddle boats for free. The excursions (many of them) are exceptionally reasonable and range from quick parasailing rides to all-day boat trips. The food was also very good. We often opted for the buffets over scheduled dinners mainly because we wanted the flexibility instead of having a reservation. The Riu's best asset, however, is the staff. They are a wonderful lot of extremely friendly and helpful people. They were very engaging and always offered an easy smile and a warm Hola. Speaking just a bit of Spanish is a help but we encountered no one that had trouble getting by even if they spoke no Spanish at all. If we had any requests at all they were attended to quickly and with great customer service. Overall, a great time. Nothing but great memories.

The hotel is beautiful, and the beach is very lovely, although somewhat breezy. I was impressed by the layout of the buffet, and the food was very good with a generous variety of items. However, by the third day I found the offerings to be redundant and tasteless. There were a couple of offerings that were appetizing, but overall not that good. If I had one complaint it would have to be that most of what was offered was cold. If you are going to buy anything to take home, take one of the tours to these small towns where the prices are resonable. Everything at the hotel and on the hotal owned market street has an exhorbitant markup. Rum is $10 dollars a bottle whereas outside the zone it is $6. Cigars are at least 60% higher here than at the factories you can tour. While our stay was fair, I was expecting more from thehotel. I don't think I will return for another visit.","date":"2015-11-23 20:30:44 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":-1,"Overall":3,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Colleen Monahan","content":"RIU Palace has a little for everybody...

We decided on Punta Cana because I found a GREAT deal for a last minute booking (1 week in advance) on Travel Zoo. Neither of us had been there before and we had never stayed at a Riu property, so we read many of the reviews on this site to get an idea about what to expect. After reading the reviews, we were somewhat apprehensive about how our stay would be, but luckily most of the things mentioned in other reviews turned out to not be true for us. We found this hotel to be a great choice and we wanted to share our experience with others that might consider staying at the Riu.RoomWe stayed in a standard room. We asked for an upgrade since it was our anniversary, but the desk clerk was not very responsive to our request (could have been a language issue), so we didn鈥檛 push. However, the standard room turned out to be nice (no smell. as mentioned in other reviews) and it was on the top floor with a king bed, just as I had requested. There were a few of those 鈥渘o see ums鈥?after they removed the complimentary fruit tray from the dresser, but the next day (after the room was cleaned) they were gone. There did seem to be a limit on the number of towels that were left in the bathroom 鈥?exactly two bath towels, two hand towels and two washcloths, but as long as we showered for dinner before the turn down service (around nine) the room attendant picked up the used towels and restocked them, so we were set for the next morning. (By the way, as mentioned in other reviews, the washcloths did seem hard to come by, they were never restocked with the other towels, but when we mentioned it to the manager, he had some washcloths brought to our room immediately). The water was only hot first thing in the morning and before dinner. That was a slight inconvenience, but not bad, since it was at least warm at the other times. Food We ate at the buffet for all our meals. We did not worry about making reservations at the other restaurants because the food in the buffet was GREAT! Some of the items were the same every night 鈥?cheeses, salads, soups 鈥?but for the most part there were different things to choose from each night - different vegetables and all kinds of meats 鈥?fish, beef (very tender), pork and baked turkey and several different pastas. One of the other reviews had us worried that there would only be fried foods 鈥?not so. I had more than my share of fresh mangos and there were many other fruits and desserts to choose from too. Beach Nice beach with white sand, some seaweed, but not bad. All the other reviewers were right about people reserving the beach chairs early but if you look around you can find some empty chairs and some shade鈥t may just take a while.ServiceAll the employees of the Riu were GREAT!! They are extremely service oriented!!!. We did tip most of the time, but they all seemed to provide the same great service to all the guests whether you tipped or not. (NOTE: I did leave a small gift (nail polish and a trial size perfume) for the room attendant and she decorated our room with flowers the second day.) OverallI would definitely return to the Riu Palace. We really enjoyed our stay. Most of the employees spoke English so that was good since we didn鈥檛 know any Spanish, although knowing some Spanish would definitely be helpful. For buying souvenirs, make the walk (it is not a short walk) to the markets on the beach. You will find much better deals than on Caribbean Street, if you are willing to haggle. I don鈥檛 believe this is the best spot for families, since about 20% of the women sunbathe and walk around without tops. I am American (definitely the minority in Punta Cana) so that was new for me, but you get used to it after the first day. Also, be advised, the DR in August is INTENSELY HOT!!!!","date":"2013-03-12 12:05:22 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":-1,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Lilian Pagac","content":"Great Hotel My Fiance and I returned from a 2 week stay at the palace (2\/6 - 16\/6) and i have to say that this hotel is amazing. I read a lot of reviews on this website before we left and i was unsure of what to expect. However, we were blown away by the hotel and especially by the staff.The staff on arrival were friendly and exlpained the various rules of the hotel, such as how to get your towels each day and when and were to eat.The room we stayed was in great condition and thankfully there was air conditioning. There is a mini bar with bottled water, soft drinks and alcohol which was restocked everyother day. They also have a safe in each room.The pool is okay but we found that, because of the palm trees, there was not much breeze so it got very hot around that area. Still, its great to have the waiter come round and take your drink order whilst your soaking up the rays!We spent most of our time on the beach, which is fantastic. The sea is clear and very clean. The only problem was you got a lot of people approaching you to try and get you to go parasailing\/scuba diving etc.ALL the staff were excellent, they do anything to help you and a big shout out goes to Rafael, our waiter in the main resturant. Most of them speak fairly good english but i does help if you know some basic spanish.The food is good but got a bit samey towards the end of our stay. Im pleased to say the we did not suffer any illness nor did anyone else that we knew of.The only negative we could find is that there isnt much entertainment in the evenings but you are free to go into the other hotels in the resort to find some.All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and came back alot more relaxed than when we left.

After reading the reviews on this website, I was more than curious about the lack of similarities between the reviews. This was a great vacation. My wife and I spent 9 nights and 10 days in paradise. The service and resort was much more than we ever expected, especially for the price. The natives of the island were a warm and firendly people. The beach was incredible with a constant breeze to keep the heat stress down. We prefed the pool in the afternoon. The lack of many kids was great. The Bambu was crawling with the rugrats, and we were glad to have stayed at the Palace. The food was nothing to write home about. I had no problems finding things to eat, but my wife (who tends to be a little more on the picky side) wasn't as thirlled with the cuisine as I. A basic knowledge of Spanish is helpful. Rough English is spoken by most workers, but remember, you are in a Spanish speaking country. We would expect them to speak English, if they came here. Also, Jonny Bravo, of the Anamacion staff was awesome. He was a blast to be around and wasn't as crude as some of the others. Again, have no concerns if you are booking your trip. It is worth your time and money.","date":"2012-10-11 20:05:42 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":-1,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":4,"Value":5}},{"author":"Mireille Roberts","content":"No Problems Just returned from a 7 day trip to the Palace.

I read many of the reviews before our trip, and feel like I was at a different resort than those with all the problems. We had a wonderful relaxing vacation. We're in our mid thirties, and just wanted to get away with no plans. This is perfect. (If you're looking for a place for kids, or for exciting places to see and visit, this is not for you.) They did have activities throughout the day to take advantage of like beach volleyball, a work out area, dancing, aerobics, and ongoing nightly festivities surrounding the dinner. (Mexican night, Caribbean night, bar-b-q at the pool, etc.) The 脗 entertainment\/shows脗 were not worth going to, but I expected that. We went to the disco one night, and the casino another, and took some long walks along the beach. The people who worked there were FANTASTIC! So upbeat, always friendly and helpful with every request. (And I consider myself pretty demanding) The tips that were most helpful included: bring plenty of singles so you can tip those that are most appreciated easily. Bring an insulated mug or larger to hold drinks colder longer. We used it for water with limes every day and were off at the beach. We brought 3 bottles of wine since we had heard the ones there weren脗 t so great, and it was great idea. If we didn脗 t finish it one night, they offered to hold it for us until the next night. Bring a clock for the room so you can see the time, and leave the rafts at home. It was no problem getting a chair by the pool or the beach. We were nervous with the weather forecast since it called for rain everyday, but rain is not like the US, it showers for about 5 minutes, and then passes and sunny like nothing ever happened. In seven days, we only had 1 totally cloudy day. (We were there March 24-31) It was great to use the Jacuzzi and they made sure that only this hotel's guests were there so we didn't feel crowded. (There were some people in it from the neighbor hotels and they nicely explained to them it was for Riu palace guests only) They told us that they were at about 85% capacity- so we had no problem with crowds. We did try the Caribe grill for dinner, cool place to go, but service not up to par with the El Patio buffet. (Plus you don脗 t get all the choices) We had a late breakfast and skipped lunch (which was usually leftovers from dinner the night before plus pizza) the food was ok- but nothing to rave about, especially after 7 days, but no complaints, lots of variety, so there was always something worth trying. The guests treated us fine (as Americans) but when you would get larger crowds of loud people, it was annoying and those tended to be Americans, so I would suggest going to one of the neighbor properties if you脗 re looking for a livelier atmosphere. I think if you go there with the right attitude, you won脗 t be disappointed. It probably helped to be able to speak Spanish, though, not a necessity. They were constantly cleaning the facilities and the beach to keep everything clean. They did have Internet facilities ($3 for every 20 minutes) if you want to stay in touch with people from home. We were on an Apple vacation and the apple reps were very friendly and helpful. A 5 or 6 day trip would have been perfect for this kind of trip and we would go back with no hesitation if we wanted this kind of relaxing vacation again some day. As for the drinks, you need to order a 脗 frozen脗 pina colada, or daiquiri, or you just get the pre-made mix which isn脗 t so good. And ask for it with extra alcohol or it doesn脗 t taste like much. (We didn脗 t realize this until near the end) Only one beer to choose from, but this seems the norm at other resorts also. You need to order from the bars that have blenders versus the one near the beach which just had the pre-made drinks and beer available. Enjoy the beautiful beaches and palm trees! Hope these tips help you enjoy your vacation as much as we did ours!","date":"2012-05-18 17:14:50 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":4,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}},{"author":"Gunnar Hermann","content":"If You Don't Speak Spanish Don't Go I am writing this becuase people should know that there is a serious language barrier at this hotel.

Been there three times and found the people rude and often lazy. This place was service with a smile the whole time. The management is very involved there presence was felt all over the place, we saw them everywhere. They run a very tight ship. I felt if I needed anything they would accomadate me. We had 2 kids with (age 9,6) they felt right at home, The towels and chairs were nice and cozy not old and weathered. The pool was very clean, the food was great and the buffet restaurant El Patio was very classy inside. The men must where long pants for all dinners there is a certain upper class feel to this hotel which was great , there was no bar flys hanging out at all the bars inhaling drinks because they are free! I hate it when the hotel is full of people who are there to take advantage of the free booze and food and act like this is there first holiday in there life! This resort was full of well traveled people and a very mature croud.

The staff was all really nice and helpful with an exception. My room did not smell like other people's expierience. The pools were nice too. They had little shops and a really cool club that plays a mixture of music. Now the bad. The front desk staff were the exception to the nice staff. They were completely unorganized and rude. The rooms don't use key cards, just keys. If you charge anything to your room be prepared to pay cash. THEY DON'T EXCEPT CREDITCARDS!!! The minibar and frige are stocked every other day.

Reception: We checked in within minutes and after nicely asking Joanna (who was extremley helpful) to be put in a room closest to the beach, she did it with no problem and no extra charge. Jose was a young, funny, and helpful young man who worked the front desk and who helped me many many times during our week stay. He gave us an umbrella after we lost ours for no charge, a converter for my hair straightner and battery chargers and such, also for no charge. The front desk staff was excellent to myself and my husband. Upon arrival we were given ice cold fruit punch and were escorted to our room (it was quite late out).The Rooms: They were clean, well lit and comfortable. We had 3 beds in which one we used for shopping and extra storage space. The safe was at no charge and I did not find any problems with it. We felt safe and comfortable leaving over $4000 US in there, including ipods, cameras, cell phones etc. The shower pressure was great and even at the busy times we never ran out of hot water. The mini was a bonus!!!! Rum, rye, vodka and gin were stocked every second day, including many different kinds of pop and a large jug of water. The AC worked very well and we often found it a litlle chilly (still not complaing!)The Food, Bars and Service: Excellent. For those that like the ala cart meals, you can book as many as you like between the hours of 7 and 10 am. We ate ala cart 4 times in a week and were very pleased. The staff was AMAZING!!!! We spent most of our time in the little Coco's bar. The drinks were made of good quality booze and they offered a martini menu after 6pm. Victor, Abel and Carlitos were the main bartenders there, they made sure that we were ALWAYS looked after. They truly made our stay that much more special.All in all, the Riu Taino was a $@!#% of a deal for the treatment that we recieved. The resort is small enough that you are never more than 10 minutes from the beach, yet big enough that even after a week we still had lots to do. The pools were clean and water sports were included.

We dont have any complaints and will defiently go back again!!We arived at aprox 20:30 so it was dark and there was a Street party that they have every thrusday going on out side our hotel so we had to be droped off at the Riu Naiboa. We were then walked to the Taino with Hotel employees bringing our bags. Check in was Fast only 2 mins and we were taken to our Bungalow! One point the rooms at the Taino have a Main power Switch as soon as you come in the door it is on the Right side it turns off all power to the room lights, tv, clock everything. (caught us off gaurd walked back and was told how to turn it on) Room was decent not amazing but suits the purpose. Tv worked and even had a few English Channels!Beach was Amazing nice blue water! warm and very enjoyable! Always found 2 chairs to sit on even after an excursion getting back at 13:00 there were still chairs! Pool was Nice and pool bar was good! A little harder to get chairs at the pool usaly by 8:30 they were all reserved (good old towel game) Staff were Fantasitc and very very friendly Wilken in the main buffet was great and always helpfull! Buffet were good never had a problem finding somthing to eat we are not pickey eaters but there should never be a problem finding food!! We ate at 2 of the dinners we ate at the Mexican wich was GREAT, food was fresh tastey and HOT! the second one we tried was the Steak house.. Out of my 7 days there this was my only complaint with the hole trip!! the prepared dinner here was just plain BAD all of it the steaks were really bad i had chicken that wasnt cooked the vegies were either WAY passed cooked or just bad!! i would not let this ruin my night so we just went to the buffet and filled up on Great food!Tips: Tips are included in your stay but that doesnt mean you shouldnt Tip its apreciated and sometimes it gets you the little extra. We tiped our Maid $2 every day and also put out little gifts for her also every day. Our Fridge was stocked every day and i left a not asking for more Brama beer and Pepesi and they were restocked every day! i left them a $2 tip also with usaly a pack of Gum!! We tried to sit in the same area in the Buffet for our meals so we could use the same people and when we recevied good service we tiped!!Excursions- we chose 2 excusions we went on the Carribien Festivle and Tropical Storm. in our opinion the Tropical storm was way better. it was alot of fun and every one enjoyed themselfs turned out to be a major Party and alot of drinkin and alot of Dancing what a great Time staf on the boat was Awsome and Capt Jose was a great Guy... when we were done this cruise we wanted to book it again it was that good and that much FUN!!!Carrabien Festivle was Fun alot more relaxed alot more Family Orientated and getting to see the Nurse Sharks and hold the Manta Rays was really neat Also.. was a little Rushed at the sharks and rays and wasnt as much Fun as Tropical storm but still nice!!hints of what to take... we didnt see ANY bugs at all.. my best advice would be to take a Thermal mug i took a 30oz and my wife took a 20oz and the bartenders had no problem filling them up for us.. Worked great.. Also bring gifts for the locals or employees its a nice thought!Our Sunquest Rep Jorge was Awsome great help and easy to talk to he help make things great for use!Anyways My Wife and i are looking forword to Returning to this Hotel again SOON we would recomend it to Anyone that wants to have a great time and relax.. if you have any questions just ask!Adanac00 and wife!","date":"2013-05-11 06:46:05 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":3,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":3,"Service":5,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.theleonard.com","vacancy":false}

We were down for a small family wedding. As a result we saw different kinds of rooms. All were clean and had hot water. In some rooms plumbing screamed. Other rooms were close to the Caribbean street and had to deal with loud music and crowd noise in the evenings until around 11:30PM. Our room was closer to the beach and quiet. Maid service was excellent. We were on the 2nd floor of a building and our AC was not super effective in the hot and humid summer weather but we had a ceiling fan and that helped.Most of the other guests were European and we heard French, German and Spanish principally. The property is well maintained and has an abundance of palms, tended flowers and grassy patches. We saw some peacocks wandering around. The beach is exquisite, very fine white sand, The sea warm and benign. Every morning I walked from 6:30 - 8AM and witnessed super efficient beach cleaners raking up seaweed from the tide and putting it in huge black plastic garbage bags. It was a very beautiful and peaceful time of day. The major pool scared me. People stayed in there longer than bladder control might extend. Heavy chlorine clouded it every night but I didn't feel like jumping in the next day and drinking at the in-pool bar!The food is fine if not particularly good. Breakfast was my favourite meal. Lots of fresh fruit, many varieties of eggs, deli meats, croissants, breads and freshly squeezed juices. Lunch and dinner served burgers, pasta, fries, rice, beans, chicken in various guises and always, a few kinds of pizza. Not inspiring but okay. Beer was cold and satisfying. Wine in casks was essentially not potable. Very inferior. Other booze not my thing when generic and served with sweet who knows what! Others seemed to be enjoying it plenty and plentifully!Front desk service was good. Especially Gregory. But all spoke English and were friendly and helpful.If you can stand the crowds, for a reasonably priced all inclusive I'd say it is pretty good.","date":"2015-09-15 22:58:50 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":3,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":3,"Value":4}},{"author":"Nayeli Hahn","content":"Had fun.. but not a 5 star hotel... Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Riu Taino On May 14th - May 21, 2007. it was a 5 star hotel.... but not really... here is my take on the hotel...Beach: Beautiful... loved it... water was cool, and wavy.. There was lots of coral reefs to snokel and look at fish. Lots of shade on the beach and very clean. If you walked down the beach you could go to a market that sold everything for cheaper then the stores in the hotel or on carribean street. Food: Well the food was not very good.. the same food all the time. We never got sick so I guess thats a good thing. The a la carte resturants were good, we enjoyed them. The alcohol is very basic and not many international drinks to chose from. Bring your own mugs to keep the drinks cold beacuse the cups that they give you are small. Pool: It was nice, we only went in it once. We were at the ocean the whole time. the pool is bust with lots of drunks and young people! Rooms: Ask to be put near the frount of the beach or the pool. Our room was in the middle of this huge resort and it was a long walk to the beacheveryday. I feel sorry for people whose rooms were all the way at the back. Basic rooms. Kept very clean . Maids were Awesome! never any problems with anything being taken from our rooms. Use the safe though. Don't lose the key 50us dollars to replace!Weather: Awesome, couldn't of asked for better! No rain only once at night time .... sun, sun, sun and more sun... It was hot..so bring lots of sun screen and hats.Entertainment! : Was funny and great! we loved it... the main guy who does all of the hosting and runs the animation was so funny and we loved him.. The shows aren't las vegas style but they are a great way to pass the evening and we laughed at them. During the day they had the entertainment by the pool, we werent there that much.Overall a great vacation. We had a lot of fun and enjoyed ourselves a lot. Beautiful gardens and beach. Lots of stuff do do and the people were very nice to us. I wouldn't say that it is a 5 star resort more of a 3 1\/2 - 4 star. But You can use the bambu which is next door and was very nice as well.. the only thing with the Riu bambu is that one afternoon while we were eating lunch in the restartant we found bugs.. i mena lots of bugs in our soup... it was really gross.. but we didnt' let it ruin our trip. Be careful for ant bites i got them everywhere all over my legs and feet. It was really annoying... and there were a lot of flies everywhere. But we didnt' bring any bug spray so you might want to bring it.!","date":"2012-10-11 02:06:19 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":3,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":2,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":3,"Value":4}},{"author":"Jeanette Dickinson","content":"Mixed Feelings My boyfriend and I traveled to the DR from March 9-14 for a short getaway from the daily grind of the East Coast. Where to begin? Before we left, we read these reviews religiously, and I will attempt to make this entry as helpful and honest as possible for whoever is traveling to this resort next. Overall, we truly enjoyed our stay. The people were great, the staff was very friendly, and the entertainment staff really did work hard to keep us engaged and entertained. The drinks were great, the beach was beautiful, and overall we're really satisfied with our vacation. The food: if you love meat, look before you eat, numerous times I cut into a piece of chicken and it was still pink. Also, we discovered that we could walk to the Riu Bambu up the beach for dinner! You should also explore Taino when you first arrive, we discovered two restaurants and another buffet place to eat on our 2nd to last day there. The resort: While Taino has the best beach access from the resort, Riu Bambu had a much more fun and lively crowd for us, especially since we are in our early 20's! We even got to dance under the stars to a live musical performance. : ) Also, the sunrise is gorgeous so try to wake up to see it one morning! My boyfriend and I love to take photos, so it was a great opportunity to take some great shots. The people: Lots of Europeans who like to wear Speedo's and go topless on the beach. Everyone was really fun loving though, which made it pleasant!VERY IMPORTANT: When it comes to the trips that the resort or your travel agent may recommend that you take, BE AWARE! We went on a day trip to SAONA ISLAND, a secluded island where we would be given unlimited alcohol and enjoy a bbq lunch on the beach, and were sorely disappointed by (1) the fact that it took 5+ hours to just get to and from the island itself, (2) the unlimited alcohol was just Rum and Coke, and what they call mamajuana and (3) the food made my boyfriend so sick that he has spent the past 12 days in the hospital (he just got out, which is why this review has taken so long for me to post). We think he caught something from the pork he had on the beach, or the fruit he had been eating, but we aren't sure. All we know is, he was fine before we went, and extremely sick the day after. The trip cost us $80 each and in our opinion, was NOT worth it, especially after the illness. ALSO (possibly even more) MPORTANT: DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT drink the water, don't even brush your teeth with it. People get really sick from it, and it just isn't worth it. Shopping: Shop AT THE RESORT SHOPS on Carribean Street at Taino- DONT buy stuff from the vendors who sell things in the lobby, because they are there to rip you off, AND the hotel doesn't even endorse their products. We bought some rum from one of the guys, and he started at $40 a bottle, and we went to caribbean street and found the same bottle for about $12. So (1) bargain with them, and (2) don't bother getting it if the price doesnt seem right, you'll find it cheaper in the shops. Also, the stores at the end of the beach have some cute stuff but be careful they will pounce on you to buy things the moment you look in their direction! Airport: Don't let people grab your bags, you will have like 6 people come try to help you and then you will have to tip each of them because they won't leave UNTIL you do! We carried our own bags, and never had that problem, but saw another couple who had 4 bags and were attacked by helpers. The bright side is, if you hate carrying your own bags, someone will be there to help you out : )Lastly, the ROOMS: Yes, the beds are hard, yes the sheets are course, yes they are a little outdated, and yes there are some mosquitoes in the room. SO: if you are particular about that kind of thing either (1) find another hotel with better beds and newer rooms, or (2) tire yourself out SO MUCH throughout the day that you will forget how uncomfortable the bed is! Also, if you leave money laying around in your room, your cleaning person may think its a tip for them (this happened to us with a few pesos), so be aware of that!DONT FORGET TO BRING: pepto bismol (it costs $9 on the resort!), bug spray (to fight those mosquitoes), and sun block (there were some REALLY red people). Also, the CDC says Punta Cana is a high risk area for malaria, so talk to your doctor if you want to be overly cautious. I would do that if we went again to that area. To sum up, would we go again? Probably not. Would we recommend the place? If you're looking for a few days of RR, a ladies week away, or just a budgeted vacation, then definitely. If you're planning a honeymoon, look elsewhere... heck, look at a different country, I hear Vancouver is pretty awesome. And you can drink the water. Contact me if you'd like photos or more information! We'd be happy to provide you with any help we can : ).","date":"2013-05-19 08:35:28 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":3,"Location":5,"Overall":3,"Rooms":2,"Service":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Miss Leonardo Littel","content":"Riu Taino a very nice holiday I just arrived home from the Riu Taino yesterday and had a wonderful time. I'd like to address some of the things I read in past reviews about this hotel. The rooms are a little dated so I wouldn't call this a 5 star but the slightly shabby rooms did not affect my holiday one bit. They are very clean and the staff at this hotel are constantly working to make it nice. We had face clothes in our rooms as well as pillow slips. The beds are firm but they are the same as any other Carribean resort that I've been to. There is no bottled water in the resort except to buy at the gift shop but the gallon jugs they provided suited me just fine for teeth brushing. Any time I ran out of anything in the room such as pop, beer or towels I called reception and they were at my room within 10 minutes. The grounds are wonderful and the beach is spectacular. The food was plentiful and I was always able to find a wide variety of things to eat. Like in all foreign countries they try very hard to make the food to our standard but it always had a Dominican twist to it. It's true that they put corn and weiners on pizza but they also had many other varieties so you didn't have to choose it if you didn't wish to. We had no problems with bugs or flies at any time on the resort or near the food. The staff was very helpful and the Animacion team worked very hard to entertain. The pools were also very nice and never in my time there did I smell sewage by the pool bar as had been reported. We had one day of rain and while walking around we could smell sewage but that's all part and parcel of going to a country that doesn't have the same level of sewers systems that we are used to here in North America. The one complaint that I have is that they will not let you change your wet beach towel in for a dry one on the same day. One towel per person per day is the allotment. To get around this we simply had one person take the towel back and obtain the card and sent another of our party to retrieve a new towel. All in all I have tosay that my holiday was a success and worth the money spent.","date":"2014-09-30 11:20:26 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":2,"Check in \/ front desk":3,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":5,"Value":3}},{"author":"Hank Kunde","content":"Absolutely Average We just got back yesterday from the Riu Taino and had read many reviews on this resort prior to going. We had read extremely positive reviews and negative ones. We have travelled to other islands in the past so we had a good basis to compare this one with. We both would rate this hotel as a absolute average to slightly above average resort. We booked this vacation through Sunquest Vacations who rated the Taino as a 5 star. Both my wife and I would say it was a good 4 star but in no way a 5 star.If you are looking for a 5 star resort then stay at the Riu Palace (sister hotel) a few doors down. It was absolutely beautiful! Getting back to the Riu Taino..... The rooms are in need of updating. The bed covers were worn and stained. Their was mold in the bathrooms and the beds were singles. We had a family of four and booked 2 Super Saver Rooms. Our price was fantastic at only $798.00 CDN plus taxes each for 1 week. We stayed from Jan 1-Jan 8 2007. The pools are not heated and were probably about 75 degrees. Not freezing but definetly cooler than expected. The ocean was about the same temp. The beach was beautiful (one of the best we have ever seen). The grounds crew kept the resort very clean but again it is in need of a serious update. The food was average (good selection) but not very tasty. The kids club very rarely had anything for the kids to do and only ever had 1 or 2 kids in it. Our kids are 8 and 9 and they chose to entertain themselves rather than go to the club. Most of the staff were very friendly but some were rude and chose to ignore you. One of the staff said to friends of ours (14 year old daughter) that she and him would do the boom boom and she would have his baby in 9 months. NOT APPROPRIATE!!! In fairness to the staff member he may not have known how old she was but he should not be saying that to any guest regardless of age. On another note the weather was about 25-30 degrees celcius every day. It was very breezy and the waves were fun for the kids. Everyday a brief downpour would happen for about 5-10 minutes (once or twice per day). Overall as mentioned before everything about this hotel is average. If you go there expecting a 5 star resort you will be disapointed. Expect a true 4 star resort and you will enjoy your stay. The family that we met from England said that it is rated a 3-1\/2 star resort in the English brochures. For the value it was a good vacation but we will look to stay at the Riu Palace next time.","date":"2012-09-22 18:40:33 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":2,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":3,"Location":4,"Overall":3,"Rooms":2,"Service":2,"Value":4}},{"author":"Randi Price","content":"beautiful beach We just returned from Punta Cana where the weather was gorgeous and the beach was the best we have every seen and we have been to Hawaii, Jamaca, Riveria Maya, Greece, Spain, California and many east coast beaches. We traveled with my three teenage children, my sister and her teenage son. All agree the beach was the best. Water sports were convenient and easy to obtain. We went snorkeling (free with the resort) with some interesting fish in the right corner of the swim area, kayaking (free with the resort), scuba diving (free trial in the pool, but extra to go on a dive) and parasailing (paid extra). If scuba diving remember to get a note from your doctor if you are taking any prescription medications!The accomadations were very nice. We liked the villa type accomadations (4 units per villa), but booking through Orbitz (even when we contacted the hotel 4 weeks prior to our arrival) we did not get all our rooms in the same building. Plus there are no connecting rooms which make it difficult for family travelers. The air- conditioning was great in all our rooms. The higher the room number, the less noice and traffic, but the maids came later (3-4 pm) at the high room numbers. Other reviews noted the pillows are all flat and there are no wash clothes. We concur, but we did not let this ruin our vacation. Food was very good in the dining area with a great variety. All the teenagers found something they liked and all had some foods\/beverages that they have never had before. The food is very un-American, which was OK with us, but would be a problem for people who were reluctant to try new things. There were french fries and pizza available at each meal for the gastronomically impaired. There is an abundance of fruit, but the staple vegetables are cabbage and carrots. Which may have contributed to the loose stool problem experienced by 4 of 7 people in our party. Also the water from the tap is not drinkable. This was very hard to remember when you are brushing your teeth. Drinkable water is supplied in abundance, but it is hard to remember not to drink from the tap. We came prepared with an antidiarrheal medication. We did eat out at the restaurant for Carribean food and Steak and our whole group agrees that it was not as good as the buffet. We do not recommend the experience.The resort pool was very nice and the 14 year old boys spent most of their time at the pool, with the 18 year olds at the swim up bar with Hector. We always got loungers, but it was a little competative by the pools particularly on Fridays and Saturdays. There were always lounge chairs on the beach with lots of palm trees to rest under. The Entertainment crew was very enthusiastic and multiligual. We attended one show, the kids loved the bingo and watched some poolside programs. They were good -- the usual quality for the resort. Probably 25% of the resort guests were from English speaking countries. We are used to travel in Europe, but if you are not then the fact that English is not the primary language can be a bit of a challenge. We did not go off the resort this trip and still found plenty to do. There does not appear to be a children's program and there were not a lot of teenagers at this resort. That was nice for us, because it was truly a family vacation, but the teenagers said they would like to come back with a group of friends!","date":"2015-08-23 12:57:08 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":-1,"Overall":3,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.exhisouthwark.co.uk\/","vacancy":true}

This was my first time visiting the Dominican and probably the last. I have stayed in several Riu hotels in Mexico and Jamaica and have always loved what the RIU offers, my mom even wears their staff shirt!We thought with a Riu it has to be nice, wrong. I hate when reviews drone on about the negatives so let me keep it simple. I'll start with the positives. The beach is amazing, just beautiful. The water was chilly, but I expected that for this time of year. There was always plenty of beach chairs so you could always find somewhere nice to sit. There is a flea market at the end of the beach, but if you're not a haggler don't go. I would rather pay the extra dollar and shop in peace at Carribean Street. They have basically the same merchandise. If you think you'll be warm in the pool, guess again. The pool was to cold to swim in, I only got in once, after several daquiris.The drinks were always tasty but the bartenders could care less how long it takes to serve you. They also speak very little English and do not make an attempt to let you understand them. no salt for your margherita is not in the Spanish language. My biggest problem with this resort is how indifferent the staff is about pleasing you. I'm not pampered by any means but they are very rude. The cashier in the hotel gift shop was upset with me because after asking her to sit items to purchase off to the side, she rang them up anyway. I told her i would come back in an hour with the money she rolled her eyes and gave me dirty look. She told my friend to tell what size t-shirt she was looking for so she would quit unfolding them!Upon check-in we were told the room would not be ready for an hour. We ate and cameback. We were taken to our room but the maid was still cleaning...we watched her clean for 20 more minutes! The room was very small with one double bed and two twin size beds! Do you go on vacation to sleep in a twin bed? The room was mustier than the usual smell, but fortunately I had brought an air freshener. The fridge in our room kept things luke warm with no temperature dial. It was on the second day we realized you had to wedge it up against the wall to keep it shut!Europeans seem to out number the Americans here. I'm not sure why but they seem to be the rudest here than I have ever experienced. They cut in front of you in line and bump into you as if you weren't even there. We found a wallet one day and tracked the people down ourselves. We weren't sure the hotel staff would bother returning it. They rewarded us with two Italian bottles of champagne! They were probably the nicest people we met whole time.These problems were only a fraction of the things that went on. I think this could be a great resort with a little time and effort, but it definitely needs improvement both physically and with the attitudes of customer satisfaction. I hope this has been helpful. I wish we had shopped for a better place. Maybe you would be better off at the Palace.","date":"2012-06-17 10:12:49 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":2,"Location":-1,"Overall":2,"Rooms":1,"Service":1,"Value":1}},{"author":"Clarissa Homenick","content":"I love Riu Taino It`d take thousand of words to say how amazing is this hotel, but all I can say is that Riu Taino is the best hotel in Punta Cana.

We had a wonderful time and would go back. Our only prior experience in Punta Cana was at the Barcelo Palace, and we would rate the two as roughly equivalent, with the Riu Taino having the edge for liveliness and staff friendliness, and the Barcelo having slightly better accommodations and food. We arrived at the Riu Taino on a Friday mid-afternoon. Since we did not take a charter, we arrived at the hotel by taxi (arranged in advance through Coco Tours, the local agent of TNT Tours) not tour bus, so there was no crowd at check in. We had scoped out the room locations in advance, and had e-mailed the hotel prior to arrival for a room closer to the beach. The hotel had e-mailed us back, indicating that they could not guarantee location, since it was their busy season. We initially were assigned to a room at the back of the property (near the Naiboa), but after some persistent (but nice) urging, the reception staff located rooms opening up the next day closer to the beach. The reception staff, particularly Rossy, was very helpful and attentive, and spoke English very well. We moved the next day, and were very happy with the location. We had two rooms on the second floor, which worked out well since our teenagers were right next to us.  We liked the bungalow set up of the Riu Taino, rather than large buildings like some other hotels. Our one complaint about the rooms (hopefully the Riu management reads these reviews) is that they really need updating, particularly as to curtains and bedding. We are more interested in the beach, pool, restaurants, etc., and did not spend much time in the room, so this was not a big deal to us. The cleaning staff deserves kudos for dealing with the mess left each day by two teenage girls. We made sure to leave a few dollars each day as our way of thanking the cleaning staff. The restaurants were satisfactory, but nothing special. We thought the food was a touch better at the Barcelo Palace, although we certainly never went hungry. We really liked the fact that food was available almost any time of day (until about mid night). When the main dining room is closed, you can get hot snacks, fruit, coffee, soda, etc. at the pizza restaurant on Caribbean Street or at the main bar area near the pool. There are two seatings, since the main restaurant is not large enough to accommodate everyone. We were assigned to the 8:30 seating, which we initially thought we would not like, but didn't try to change and actually ended up liking the late dinner (we would get a late afternoon snack at the bar to hold us over). We exercised the same caution with buffet food as we would in the U.S. We stuck to the hot food, fruits, pizza and breads, and stayed away from the salad bars and cold food. (The salad bar and cold food looked fine, just our self-imposed caution.) We did not experience or hear anyone else complain about any of the illness problems that have garnered a lot of attention. The hotel was extremely clean, and they seemed to go out of their way to keep it that way. We didn't notice a flying or walking bug the whole time. The food definitely reflected the European clientele, with a number of hot dishes with a Germanic tone to them. We would have liked to see more grilled to order fish and chicken, rather than grilled foods prepared in advance and then set out in pans. There was plenty of red meats, but we are not heavy meat eaters, so we can't attest to the quality. The clientele definitely was heavily European, with a large percentage of Germans, some French, and a variety of others (Italy, Eastern Europe, etc.). There was a heavy contingent of wild and crazy English speaking Canadians (is there any other type?), but just a few Americans. Contrary to some reports, the Germans were just fine, but somewhat more reserved, which could be misinterpreted as rude. Our casual observation was, nonetheless, the closer you got to the buffet, the more likely you were to have a close encounter with a German senior citizen coming back for more.  The Europeans smoke incessantly, which we also observed at the Barcelo Palace. It was shocking to see mid-teen Europeans chain smoking in front of their parents. The ventilation was good everywhere except the disco and the bar off the lobby, so this was not a huge problem. The animacion staff, particularly Rigo, Rosa, Jimy and their boss (never did get his name) were great. For us, this was the key difference which likely will cause us to return to the Riu Taino over the Barcelo Palace. The pool area was a buzz of activity, and the staff extremely energetic and friendly. I never got the feeling that anyone was looking for a tip, although we handed out plenty of tips just before we left to thank the animacion staff for making our trip so great. The beach is beautiful, although less intimate than the Barcelo Palace. We had a particularly windy week, so we ended up spending more time at the pool than we had anticipated. The pool chairs were reserved early (by 8 a.m. they were gone), but that was not a problem for us since I got up early each morning for a run on the beach. For you runners out there, the beach is more suited to running than at the Barcelo Palace, since it is wider with more of a water line (so you don't have to run on heavy sand). Having run a half-hour or so in each direction, I can attest that the Riu Taino has the best beach in sight.  We did not spend much time at the other Riu hotels. The Riu Palace looked beautiful, but was too fancy for our tastes (we go away to dress down, not dress up). The Riu Bambu was much newer, but we liked the location of the Riu Taino, which was closer to the beach and Caribbean street. We were much more comfortable letting our teenagers stay out late at the disco on Caribbean street since it was just minutes from the Riu Taino, but farther from the Riu Bambu. Our only complaint, if you call it that, is that the Riu needs to exercise closer control over the independent vendors they allow on the property. We had a bad experience with the hairdresser (for braiding) on Caribbean Street, which has a booth at the pool. We were willing to pay more than the braiding at the market down the beach, for the convenience of having it done at the pool. The braiding was not the way my 14 year old daughter had described (probably a language problem), but when we asked them to correct it, they wanted to charge us another $20. The money was insignificant, but we objected to paying more just to get it right. The owner of the hair salon was extremely aggressive, going to the extent of trying to get the manager of the Riu Taino to force us to pay. Fortunately, the manager, a very nice guy from Spain, backed us up 100%.  Also, the hotel allows outside vendors into the hotel lobby once a week to show their wares, mostly jewelry, cigars, paintings and tee shirts. This is fine with us, but we felt uncomfortable since the vendors were aggressive in trying to get us to buy. This is fine when this happens at the beach market, but not on the hotel property. These minor complaints, however, hardly detracted from our overall experience. We would rate the Riu Taino a solid 4+ star (by Punta Cana standards), and it would be a 5 star with a little cosmetic updating. We will be back for sure.

Despite the weather, we really enjoyed our vacation. Upon arrival, our room wasn't quite ready so, we grabbed a couple of drinks in the bar. Imagine our delight when we did get our room and we were upgraded from a regular room to a suite. The room was gorgeous and very, very clean. Our housekeeper Lucia did a super job eveyday and left us towel swans and flowers everyday as well. It was a noce touch that did not go unnoticed.The resort itself is just gorgeous and very clean. It was nice to have access to the other Riu's as well. The beach is beautiful and clean. One day when we were walking on the beach, we saw a local up at the top of a 50 foot palm tree getting coconuts. It was pretty cool to see...once in a lifetime kind of thing.The staff at the Riu Taino is amazing , pleasant and try very hard to help. Despite reviews I read before I left, they're English is not as bad as other reviews say...be patient...they are listening to many different languages day in and day out.The food is plentiful and very tasty. I ate just about everything. I had a bit of upset stomach one day but, my boyfriend was fine the whole time.All in all, we had a great vacation and I would recommend the Riu Taino for anyone's vacation!!!

Dont be scared, you will make a lot of friends. The pool, and ocean are beautiful. This resort is along side 4 other of it's sister resorts and you can travel freely from each. There are 5 shows at any givin night to attend. The shows are really good, and funny and beautiful. There is deffinatly a show for every single person. They have amazing water sports. Not a lot of places include everything, but they really do, and whatever they dont include, you can buy it for very cheap. Every night a bazaar comes to one of the 5 resorts and you can hagal items for just about any price. I think there were 2 or 3 resteraunts to attend but my party didn't even go to one because we were perfectly happy with the buffets, filling everyone's needs.

Print that review out and take it with you if you plan on going.I went with my girlfriend and my parents and we had an absolutly wonderful time. The staff is amazing. They are so energetic and fun to be around. During the day they have all kinds of activities that include, aerobics on the beach, water polo, soccer on the beach, ping-pong tournament, dance lessons by the pool, water aerobics, etc. etc. etc.The food was very good for the most part. There were plenty of choices. The two a-la-carte restaurants were average. I found the food better at the buffet restaurant in the hotel.The beach is simply beautiful and there is incredible snorkling right off the beach where we saw many specicies of exotic fish and a octopus. There were a lot of Europeans and many women went topless.Yes. I did get sick. But that was because I accidently used the hotel water to brush my teeth and because I drank a lot of booze the entire trip. However, if you are careful, this can be avoided.My impression of the Riu Taino was that it was a younger more fun Riu out of the Riu hotels in Punta Cana. There were a lot of younger couples, and honeymooners. Also, it is very close to the beach. Whereas other Riu hotels were set back further from the beach. It is also next to Caribbean Street that has a bunch of stores and the Pachu Disco as well as the Casino that is part of the Riu Palace.Rooms. The rooms were nice and clean. Nothing fancy. I travel a lot for work and I thought the rooms were great.I would definately go back to Punta Cana and if you are doing your research, I would strongly recommend the Riu Taino.","date":"2015-03-30 02:37:57 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":5,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}},{"author":"Ollie Murazik","content":"AMAZING- wanna go back STAFF~ they were all out going........if your in the ages between 14-19.....u will have sooo much fun with the staff..FOOD~ it wasn't that great but it was edible....there were always french fries to eat....HOTEL~ overall the hotel was very clean....the people were very nice.......NIGHTLIFE~ doesn't matter how old you are you can get into the disco.....the age is 18.....i'm 14 and i got in.....you just ahve to watch yourself because the guys come on a little too storg but you just push them away.....they will listen...i have no clue how people are saying they didn't have a fun time....because i stayed 2 weeks and started to cry leaving there...........i would recomend this hotel to EVERYONE........","date":"2012-02-11 04:00:37 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":5,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}},{"author":"Katharina Halvorson","content":"no encontre la constelaci贸n de las 5 estrellas   showReview(20102968, 'full');","date":"2015-08-01 06:55:47 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":3,"Check in \/ front desk":3,"Cleanliness":3,"Location":3,"Overall":3,"Rooms":1,"Service":2,"Value":2}},{"author":"Alfonzo Hermann III","content":"me encantoooooooo   showReview(10028060, 'full');","date":"2012-04-17 21:36:05 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":5,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Monique Torp","content":"I stayed here for two weeks and base my review on the aggregate visit and observations of both properties. First, know that there are two locations for Vantaggio Suites in San Diego: the State Street property, which is like a very run down and poorly managed combination of youth hostel and frat house, and the Broadway Street property, which is comprised of several individually-owned units thrown into the Vantaggio Suites rental pool. It seemed like a poor rendition of a time-share situation; however, there was no effective management or oversight to speak of and there would certainly not be any takers were this a \"real\" time share property. Pros: State Street property is right on the edge of Little Italy in downtown San Diego, directly across the street from Amici Park. There is easy I-5 freeway access, and plenty of Italian restaurants and shops easily within walking distance of less than a block. And with a short walk toward the San Diego bay, this place has got location, location, location (but no parking!). There are common areas like you would find in a frat house as well as a laundry room. It is a highly international clientele, with Japanese advertisements and postings all over the place. Broadway Avenue property is further east from San Diego, located on Broadway between 26th and 27th Streets past the East Village area. It's a fairly residential area but is quite unsafe in the evenings. There are bars on the windows and a gated entrance and gated garage (which is included in the room price). The area is very Hispanic, and there are a few Mexican restaurants within walking distance (but I'd recommend only do this during daylight hours). There's a fire station within a block, so expect to hear lots of sirens. Rooms come with balconies and kitchen facilities, complete with full-sized fridge, microwave, dishwasher, stove. There is unlimited wired internet access. There is a small TV, about the size of a 17\" computer flat screen. Cons: First let me say that I am jaded about this place and would absolutely NOT recommend it to anyone. This is due to the fact that I had two \"accidents\" on the property and sustained injuries and bruises, and I gave up trying to assign responsibility for the poor condition of not only the elevator but the emergency and stairwell access. The elevator broke, with me in it, and dropped a floor very quickly. I was thrown to the floor injuring my back and left side\/hip\/leg. To add insult to injury, neither the alarm nor the doors worked so I was trapped inside. Calls to the management office were futile and they declined knowledge or responsibility to the property, so I called 911. The firemen had me out in about 20 minutes; however, they could not find the stairs (because the stairs were unmarked, and they are also inaccessible from outside the stairwell meaning that you can get out but you can't get in). We had to walk completely around the block (on my injured hip and leg and back, no less) in order to get into the complex. Anyway, to make a horrible story shorter, Vantaggio Suites management and employees, NNJaescke Property Management and employees, and the owner of the actual unit all pointed to each other and the State of California for responsibility for the malfunctioning elevator and my injuries. By the end of my stay there, I felt like it was my own fault. Other cons for Vantaggio Suites at Broadway: - Filthy dirty. Old, ragged carpet that was not only frayed but was a trip hazard. - Old dirty curtains. When you pulled the fabric curtains opened, you held your breath that the curtain rod would not collapse, and you literally had to unstick your hand from the dirty fabric. - Damaged screens with holes. Place was so dirty that there were spider webs (inside!) and bugs flying in and out. With no air circulation, no fan, and no air conditioning, and weather in the 100 degree range, I had no choice but to leave the windows opened. - Murphy bed. It was down when I arrived, which was a good thing because I could not get it to raise or go back into the wall. - Stinks! This place smells like old garbage. Though it is getting a facelift, repainting, and fixing the front courtyard area, it is still a very old building that resembles a converted flop house or homeless shelter. - Dishes and utensils provided were well used and dirty. Though there was a dishwasher, apparently the previous occupant had not used it and nobody checked (or they checked but did not care). Dishes were past spotty ... they had grime on them. I promptly threw every dish and pan I could find into the dishwasher and ran them myself. - Plastic utensils (spoon, spatula) they had provided were melted in half and unusable, so I took them to the front desk where they promptly laughed me out of the office. I ended up purchasing my own set and taking them with me. - Combo tub and shower were in a decent sized bathroom area. However, it was a very old metal tub (read: slippery). Because of a fall, I ended up purchasing my own bath mat. - Old construction! This means that the walls are thin, and the permanent apartment residents do have their own TVs and stereos that echo around the complex. It's shaped in a square with the courtyard in the middle, so the noise bounces inside the place. Also, the couple on the 4th floor (the top floor) had hardwood floors and sounded like the walked everywhere with tap shoes on. - Remember that this operates much like a time share, so you do not have cleaning service. If you desire, they can schedule once per week refreshment\/upkeep cleaning, for $150 per month. I would have run screaming in another direction within 10 minutes of arriving there and gone to another property if given the choice. However, the entire stay would have been non-refundable. When I voiced my concerns to the management at the front desk, the response was \"you can leave whenever you want, but there's no way we're giving you back any money.\" You have been warned ... I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy!","date":"2014-09-17 15:06:50 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":1,"Location":4,"Overall":1,"Rooms":1,"Service":1,"Value":1}},{"author":"Deondre Hayes","content":"Donner une chance   showReview(23041145, 'full');","date":"2013-07-16 12:08:24 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":3,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}},{"author":"Mrs. Pansy Lind","content":"staff not approachable, not helpful at all. check in was ok, we're booked for 1 night. we said to extend another night. receptionist said ok. we paid for the extended night. we were touring dubai when we get a call that we have to leave because our room is reserved for somebody else!! big hassle, big disappointment. the apartment is ok. but the staff needs to learn how to serve their customers right.","date":"2012-11-11 08:36:40 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":3,"Overall":2,"Rooms":3,"Service":1,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":3}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.londonbridgehotel.com\/","vacancy":true}

(treadmill, eliptical, modern weighted pull system (dont know the correct term), mats, mirrors) The roof is outfitted with a business area- and a wonderful floor to ceiling room where guests have breakfast, but can hang out whenever they like, 24 hours. There is food available all the time, with swanky smoothies and greek salads in glass jars...very green of them, and very appreciated. You can eat it upstairs or bring it to your room. They also have a bar set up where it is a trust system- you fill out a little form then take the kind of wine or other libation you desire. (there is a charge for that, but not for the food). This all means that there isn't a refrigerator in the room, which was fine with me. I have terrible allergies and the staff went to great lengths to look up the ingredients of the many breads they had available, printed it out and translated it all for me. One of the other reviews mentioned the lack of fresh air. This is true, it is impossible to open a window and it was rather frustrating.

Breakfast is an excellent buffet, with plenty of choice, and the option of also ordering eggs\/pancakes etc. And what's really nice is that the room is kept open for the rest of the day, and they serve free food (light snacks like breads, sandwiches, small bowls of couscous, chocolate mousse etc) and drinks (delicious homemade smoothies, tea, coffee, juices).

The line (U8) doesn't take you anywhere interesting really but it's easy to change lines at Alexanderplatz. In-room Wi-Fi was perfect. There are two Macs and a printer to use on the top floor. The best and most distinguishing feature of this hotel is the Tentiempie: the top floor restaurant area with great views. Breakfast is very good and served until 11am on weekdays, until 2pm on weekends. To top it off you can go there for snacks anytime you want by yourself - or just take something away to your room. There are croissants, fresh fruit, crisps, coffee and tea, a fridge full of sodas, juices and bottled water etc. etc. - all for free. The top floor area also has a self-service bar that works on the honor system. So you could mix yourself a drink, just how you like it. A\/C worked great even though the temperatures were over 30C most of the time. I highly recommend the Casa Camper for anyone visiting Berlin.","date":"2012-10-13 10:24:12 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Mrs. Hester Bergnaum","content":"Not the greatest place, but still had a good time! We stayed at Natura Park from Dec 4- 11\/08. We paid $1950 for 2 people. All inclusive of course. We have previously been to Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic and Varadero, Cuba. We flew with Air Transat and both flights were uneventful.... this time we paid more for the extra leg room which is a MUST - definitely worth it! I would not recommend Natura Park to anyone if they asked me if they should stay there. We had very good service at the front desk, they were always attentive. The grounds are very beautiful and well taken care of. Lots of ponds, bridges, flamingos, geese, ducks and BATS at night (EWWW) The beach was amazing of course (though there was a lot more seaweed here than any of the other places we've been). The open beach to the left of the resort is very nice - secluded and nice for walking. No problems finding loungers on the beach, by the pool is a bit more difficult. The food was ok - not the greatest but we never went hungry. We mainly ate at the buffet which always had a good variety of food (pasta, stirfry, omelets, etc). The seafood restaurant was horrible - the food was undercooked and they did not even have lobster. We ended up walking out and going to the buffet instead. The steakhouse was really good, no complaints there. We did not try the Italian restaurant but heard the buffet was better. These a la carte restaurants book up fast so get your reservations in as soon as you get there. All of the bars are quite good. It seems that none of the bartenders can make the same drink though - haha - you ask for something and they will each make you a different one! The male bartender at the bar by the steakhouse made a really good strawberry daquiri (he was usually there at 6:30PM until closing). The nightly entertainment was usually very good (Michael Jackson impersonator, karaoke, dancing, etc).The rooms were something else - and not in a good way. The maids did a good job, though sometimes they take your towels at like 8 AM and you do not get fresh ones unitl 4PM..... The room appeared to be ok - a bit outdated but we are used to that from places before. Our room (# 3230 in building 12) had a major wiring problem and even though someone came to fix it twice, we had no bathroom light for 4 days. Plus we found a huge mouse in our room one night, chased it out, and looked around to find that our ceiling air conditioner had a huge nest in it..... we've never had problems like that before. The power went out quite a bit too, usually in the early evening, but did not last too long.We did the tropical storm excursion for $89 USD per person which is going out on a catamaran for the day. You leave around 8AM and return around 4PM. This was a really fun day! You get to go cruising around the ocean and go by a shipwreck just off Bavaro beach, crash through some monster waves (and got soaked!!), go snorkeling in the reef, have lunch, lots of drinks, and go to the natural pool. I would go on this one again, should we ever return to Punta Cana.We also did the monster truck tour for $90 USD per person which we really liked as well. Our tour guide Gregory made this trip a lot of fun! You drive through the countryside (with drinks of course) and stop at a typical Dominican farm where you try fresh fruits and other products, then you go to a cock fight (which I did not watch - poor things), then you stop at a Dominican school (take supplies for the kids). Then stop for lunch at the river (pretty good food). The final stop is at a Haitian voodoo village. This was disappointing as I thought we'd get to see some voodoo, no such luck. You just walk through the little hut and check out the wierd stuff inside. You leave around 7:30AM and get back around 5:30PMWe visited Manati Park when we were there ($15 USD per person.) Totally not worth it. It is like a really crappy zoo and we saw some guy hitting a parrot there who wasn't performing properly in their little entertainment gig .... I'm totally anti-animal cruelty so that was really hard to see. Don't bother visiting the mall ... there are a lot of stores but they are all quite expensive. The shuttle is free from most hotels - it drops you off and then leaves you there for like 2 hours - it will take you about 1\/2 hr to walk through the mall and then you'll sit there and wait for the rest. There is a market close to Natura Park. You can find some good stuff but they really try to rip you off. The general rule is when they give you a price drop it down to half of what you are actually wiling to pay and go from there. Most of the time you end up getting a pretty good deal. You do have to walk out of the resort to get to the market and we were a bit wary at first because you have to walk through some new development and there are a lot of onlookers but every went ok - we walked there twice. The shop in the resort is also ok - but more expensive than the markets of course.I don't think I missed anything.... if you have any questions feel free to ask!","date":"2015-12-10 02:38:49 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":3,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":3,"Location":4,"Overall":2,"Rooms":2,"Service":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Green Huel","content":"Hmmmm ... We were placed here for one night by the tour operator after our flight home was delayed for 24 hours due to a tropical storm (the resort we'd been staying at for the previous 14 nights was full so we had to move). Reception was chaos with lots of other travellers in the same boat, but the receptionists coped well and got us checked in fairly quickly. The rooms were very basic for a resort purporting to be 5*. Perhaps I'm being a little unfair - they were clean but extremely tired and dated looking, however, especially having been in a brand new modern resort for the previous 2 weeks. However, the grounds were great with loads of palm trees, birds like flamingos and herons, running around the place. The pool is too small for the number of guests. The beach area is very good with plenty of beds, shade, and inclusive watersports. The main public areas like reception, the bar and the restaurants are not air-conditioned and in the tropics this is a problem. Overall, it was fine for an emergency one-night stop, but there are far better, more modern resorts close by.","date":"2014-07-31 01:01:44 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":3,"Location":4,"Overall":3,"Rooms":2,"Service":3,"Value":3}},{"author":"Julius Kihn","content":"Not A Good Experience!

We did some research about the resort including this website and had mixed feelings about we read but decided to try it anyway, what the $@!#%, it was cheap enough.We arrived at the resort around 10:00 pm on March 30th and were very impressed with the reception that we received. We were into our room within a half hour with drinks at hand. We had requested a room with a king size bed but to our disapointment, we ended up with 2 double beds. So, we went back to the front desk to see if this could be changed. They were quite full that night but said for us to go back in the morning and they would see if they could accomadate us. By 2 pm the following afternoon, we were in our new room with a king size bed and that was the worst part of our whole trip.The food was good (I'm not so fussy but my wife is a bit more selective and she was very impressed with all the selections they had) specially the pasta counter. The service was exceptional and deserved to be complimented specially Rapha毛l at the bar above the pool bar, Anthony at the La Perla Restaurant for the lunch buffet and Sandro\/Jos茅 at the Mirgenta Bar along with everyone else on the resort...........too many names to mention them all or to remember.The entertainment was a mixture of professional and audience participation shows, some nights were better than others. The professional shows were really well orchastrated and very well performed.The weather was 70\/30 but on the so so days, we went for a walk (about 20 minutes) to the local market which was very challenging (who doesn't like a challenge every once in a while), it was fun bartering for the best price.The beaches were very beautiful with their turquoise water and white sands. The water was warm almost like bath water and the scenery was good too. You could walk for miles and miles all day long if you wanted. There was a bit of seaweed but there was someone raking it up every morning. There was lots to do, kayaking, peddle boats, wind surfing, snorkeling and last but not least, you could drink all you wanted anywhere, anytime.The resort itself was very clean and very well maintained. The vegetation was beautiful with lots of different greenery. It also had different types of birds roaming free (pink flamingos, ducks, geese and other species). They even provided the bread to feed the fish, birds and turtles which made for a relaxing morning.One night, we even walked down to the Casino at the next resort and, much to our surprise, we actually made a little bit of money ($24.00 American dollars). It was worth the 10 minute walk.All in all, after being to a resort in Mexico that was rated a 4 1\/2 star and a lot more expensive (which we wouldn't recommend to anyone that we know), our vacation to Natura Park Eco was very satisfying. We are looking forward to going back with friends.PS: We met a lot of people from Canada whom we'll never forget.","date":"2014-08-24 15:48:52 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":4,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}},{"author":"Francis Reichel","content":"A very enjoyable week at the Natura!

It is hard to give an overall impression of the hotel as some things were great, while others poor. The hotel is a short 20 minute drive from the airport (nice looking airport, but the staff will try to extort as much money from you as they can...). It really is in the middle of nowhere, and the area is not pleasant smelling once you get off the resort property.The property itself is quite nice, more natural looking than most - with the exception of the fish ponds\/lagoons that are very clearly artificial. It is fun to see and feed the fish and birds that are all over the place. The buildings incorporate a lot of natural materials, which give it a more rustic feel. The beach is a decent size, but there is a lot of seaweed. This is mainly due to the strong winds (which actually help keep you comfortable during the day).The rooms were a disappointment. Everything in them smells musty, and we had little ants of some kind in the bathroom and on the desk. Thankfully, they didn't get into our stuff. The beds were harder than any futon I've ever slept on, and I had a sore neck all week as a result. The electricity is definitely an issue - some of the lights didn't work, and a surge blew out my battery charger. We did have hot water and the A\/C worked well, so we were lucky compared to some. Don't travel with anyone you might be shy around, as the bathroom doors are made of slotted wood, and only slide back and forth. Note that noise carries pretty easily, especially near the theatre.The food was hit or miss. Generally, when the meat was cooked properly, it was quite flavourful. The pasta was generally okay. There were issues with keeping food hot though, and both me and my friend ended up with intestinal problems (and when they say don't drink the water from the taps, this includes brushing your teeth!). The a la carte restaurants weren't anything special. Service varied wildly depending on who you had, although the people at the bars were quite nice. Considering the variety of countries that they draw visitors from, I was impressed that most staff could converse in English, French, Spanish or German. The entertainment staff tried, but some of the shows were a litlle slow. Excellent dancers though.The prices at the hotel store were decent (good selection if you forgot anything), but you could get better if you haggled well with the merchants that came on site a few times a week. Don't accept their first or second offers though! They do get a bit annoying though as every one of them wants you to stop and look at their stuff. None of it is really original, as you can get the same items elsewhere on the island if you go into town or on a tour. Do take a tour though, as it will give you a better idea of the island outside of the hotel.  I am glad I went, but I wouldn't go back to this hotel again.","date":"2013-04-01 21:05:48 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":3,"Check in \/ front desk":2,"Cleanliness":3,"Location":4,"Overall":3,"Rooms":2,"Service":3,"Value":2}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.thelondonearshostel.com\/","vacancy":true}

Natura Park ReviewWe (my husband, my 6 year old son and I) stayed at the Natura Park Resort from May 26th, 2007 to June 2nd, 2007.We have traveled to Punta Cana several times before, and it is safe to say 鈥?this was the worst vacation ever!!!!!!Here is our opinion of the resort and the (non-existing) customer service:Grounds: Beautiful landscape with lush greenery, lagoons, fish, flamingoes and, among other wild life, a bunch of geese. One of them, a large white male goose, viciously attacked my 6 year old son on the first day of our stay when we attempted to pass him on one of the walkways. The bird picked him so hard that he broke the skin in several places. Please do imagine the shock the child was under, since the bird, when aggravated and flapping his wings, was as tall as he was. Needless to say, I brought this unfortunate incident to the attention of the lady at the guest service desk 鈥?her response to me (in very broken English) was: This is an ECO Resort 鈥?Deal with it! I also voiced my complaint about the bird to the Apple Representative, who was told that the bird was very territorial and that management was aware that all vacationers as well as the staff were afraid of it. The only people capable of dealing with the animal were the ground keepers, since they had rakes, shovels etc. the defend themselves.We watched that bird attack 3 different people one evening within 10 minutes鈥? You tell me 鈥?is that something guests should be faced with as soon as they leave their room? Check In: Fast, again front desk staff spoke very little English.Rooms: Shabby, outdated and, above all, in bad repair. Toilet needed to get fixed sometimes twice daily, bathroom floor flooded, TV needed repair. Again, you need to walk all the way up to the reception to ask for maintenance, since if you try to phone the front desk or guest service, their English skills are not adequate to carry on a conversation.Pool: Dirty, even first thing in the morning.Food in the main Buffet Restaurant:Let me start by saying that we are animal lovers 鈥?but having birds sit in the scrambled eggs (and eating from it, of course) in the morning and subsequently walking through all the food platters is disgusting and definitely not improving anyone鈥檚 health. No wonder people were getting sick left and right. The food should have been covered up or one of the many staff members, just standing around involved in personal conversations could have chased the birds away.The food was tasteless, every day with no variety. They were also not very imaginative when it came to use up the leftovers from the day before. YUK. A la Carte Restaurants:First, they were just open one at the time, so if you were in the mood for seafood on Monday, you were out of luck since Monday the Steak House was open. Media Luna Restaurant (Steak House):We had a reservation for 6:30 PM and when we arrived on time, the wait staff was still setting up. They seated us, but didn鈥檛 even asked us if we wanted something to drink 鈥?never mind a menu 鈥?until well after 7:00 PM. When someone finally came to take our order, we asked for 2 beers and a 7-Up for our son. Not too difficult, one should think. We tried to order the Rib eye steak, which was not available that night and then settled for a Filet Mignon with mushrooms. Instead of mushrooms, the filet came buried under a mountain of onions 鈥?without any explanation. When after the meal we still hadn鈥檛 received our drinks (even though we had reminded the waiter repeatedly, we just got up and left. Staff is grossly incompetent.La Perla Restaurant (Snack bar during the day and seafood restaurant at night):Same incompetent wait staff from Media Luna the day before. Lobster was according to the waitress not in season so I ordered Shrimp pasta, which was the same pasta that is available at lunch with 3 shrimp on top. Very disappointing. My husband ordered the filet of sole, which was served under some saut茅ed veggies in aluminum foil. Lots of veggies 鈥?very little fish.Pasta Restaurant:We didn鈥檛 go since we anticipated the same lousy service and tasteless food.Entertainment: Nowhere to be found. No live music and the shows were marginal at best.Animacion: There were about 6 very disinterested people that gave us the impression they were just waiting for their shift to be over. Not much happening.Kids Club:This was the worst 鈥?we had picked this hotel since Apple vacations advertised a kid鈥檚 club from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.On our first day, I tried to take my son to the club and no employee showed up until 10:30 AM. I ended up leaving him at the kids club with a rather bored looking member of the animation team, who parked him in front of a TV and proceeded to put her feet up on a table and enjoy her book. To make matters worse, while sitting at the pool bar 鈥?we saw our son happily swimming towards us in the pool. Apparently, the girl didn鈥檛 understand she was to supervise the child until we would get back. Also, she informed us that the kid鈥檚 club was about to close for lunch from noon to 3:00PM!!!!!!!!!When I addressed the issue with the guest service clerk, I was again faced with an employee that spoke very little English and cared even less.So, if you have a child, stay far, far away from the Natura Park Hotel.Management:We tried to speak to the General Manager one evening about our concerns (that day that the toilet was still not working after they fixed it twice that day and the bathroom floor was flooded, we were told that it was dinner time and the manager was in the restaurant eating. We asked the front desk clerk to please call him and asked him to speak to us. The clerk even went downstairs to inform the GM, but no response. I was contacted the next day by guest services to make an appointment to finally speak with the GM 鈥?which I did. The appointment was set for 6:00 PM and when I got there (on time, of course) the GM was nowhere in sight. I was informed that he was on his way to the hotel and had car problems. Right! As we found out later, he used the same excuse for other unhappy guests that tried to speak with him.All in all, you can鈥檛 blame the staff for the less than marginal service 鈥?if management doesn鈥檛 care, why should they!This was by far our worst vacation ever 鈥?we will definitely never go back to the Natura Park Hotel.","date":"2012-01-22 00:23:25 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":2,"Check in \/ front desk":2,"Cleanliness":2,"Location":3,"Overall":1,"Rooms":1,"Service":1,"Value":1}},{"author":"Rebeca Fisher","content":"Great Resort - Terrible Service From Sun Wing Arrived at Natura on Mar.31 in the p.m. - 5 of us which included 2 children.

This was one of the nicest family resorts I've been too..and believe me, I've been to one not so nice...not half as nice as Natura. Would definitely go back. Beach was beautiful, pool was small but was perfect for us with the children - never out of our sight. Entertainment and activities for all...nightly shows were a bit cheesy but fine....can't comment on what happened past the shows as we were in the sack and up early for another beautiful day at the beach (or pool).

By 3:00 a.m., we had airport staff track someone down (in Toronto).... were making offers that were ridiculous i.e. find your own way back to Hfx if you didn't want to drive back to Hfx in a snow storm in 4 clunky school buses (which never did arrive at the airport like we were told by the way) ....absolutely absurd..meanwhile, lucky travellers from other co's were flown back to Hfx by 9:00 a.m. the next day. Sun Wing rep. was finally contacted by phone from the hotel the next day - no help at all.....we found him with the help of a fellow passenger and the hotel front desk clerk but by then (after 11:00 a.m.) because we were all exhausted and told there were no other accommodations to be made, we climbed aboard...thank goodness we had great bus drivers ...trust me when I say once again (with support from appx. 70 other people)...stay away from Sun Wing!!!!!!

This horrible experience began with a simple idea for a group of 8 friends to share a vacation in the Caribbean. We initially made our own reservations for a weekend stay at the resort and made multiple calls both before the trip, upon arrival to the country and again the day before we drove to the resort. The hotel staff confirmed our reservations each instance we called. Not until we arrived at the hotel early in the afternoon did we find out the staff there had LIED to us!!! They had given, yes given away our rooms which were reserved months ahead of time, to a tour group!!!! Even as we repeated our claims time and time again to staff at the reservation desk we were ignored and at one instance even told to shut up. They would not even give us the opportunity to speak to a manager, who according to them was not at the hotel that day. Finally after over an hour they found an assistant manager who admitted they lied to us each time we called to confirm. As we waited for the manager we saw multiple guests of the hotel approach the counter with their own complaints. They ranged from bugs in their rooms to bathrooms that didn't work and the staff did little to accommodate them. This experience left a nasty taste in our mouth the rest of the time there. In the end we were sent to another resort and no restitution for the lost day and aggravation. To sum up the staff are rude and unapologitic aswell as liers, and from the sounds of it the facilities are deteriorating. Don't bother going!

He showed three hours late for orientation and blamed us for the mistake. On this note get use to time deadlines not being made by employees.5. Bring plenty of American cash.

There is always something to complain about if you want to, but it was definitely a nice resort.We travelled with another family and had 4 children between us (ages 5, 7, 9 11). The kids were feeling a bit too old for the Kids Club but did participate in the Mini Disco show when they could. Petra was nice and did invite the kids to the club. Jimy encouraged the kids to participate in daily activities at the pool and on the beach. He was very friendly. They had sand toys and games by the pool - shuffleboard, mini-golf, bean bag toss etc.The beach did have seaweed. What built up over the day was collected each morning, so it wasn't horrible. There seemed to be more build up on the hotels next door (Allegro, Punta Cana Grand). We spent most of our time at the pool - though the older kids did some snorkelling. It was windy - so the ocean was wavy but the breeze was nice. It did bring in some clouds - and sunshowers, but really only lasted a minute or two.The rooms were average and we got good maid service. We did not use anything in the Mini Bar because we didn't need to. We had plenty of towels, soap etc. We got lots of water in big bottles every day.Don't buy from the vendors (sharks) that come on to the resort. They wear pink\/peach shirts and hound you if you are around the pool. You can get much better deals at the hotel gift shop or if you feel like bargaining there is a market down the beach at the Punta Cana Grand (to the right). But beware, they will all want you to visit their shop for the cheapie, cheapie deals. Just be prepared to haggle or say no. We ate at all the restaurants -including the beach grill and none of us got sick. We liked the smoothie bar at the main buffet. But there was always a wait.The resort was getting busier as our week progressed and we did have to line up for lunch at the main buffet one day (I think they weren't able to clean up tables fast enough) and the pool restaurant was more crowded. But really what is the rush if you are on vacation?DO NOT change any money into Dominican Pesos. Everywhere takes US dollars and you can't change the Pesos back to any other currency. DO NOT take the bus to the Palma Real shopping center. It took over 40 minutes with all the stops at other hotels and there were only 4 stores open. It will be nice when it is done, but give it another year or so.DO take a bun and feed the turtles at the bridge at the front entrance. It is a hoot to watch the turtles, ducks and fish fight for the food. They all seem to come out of nowhere.DO take the country adventure\/safari trip. We went with County Adventures - there are lots of tour companies that do it. You get to see a Dominican home, a school, a sugar plantation, a coffee\/cocoa ranch, have a horsback ride and boogie board at a beautiful beach. (And the requisite stop at a tourist gift shop - with items made in China). The kids really learned a lot about how easy they have it. Also we took some school supplies to leave at the school (pens, pencils, erasers, crayons, notebooks etc). Enough said. Enjoy the quietness of the resort. There are no other attractions (other than a Casino) around, so you will relax. Take sunscreen and bug spray (we did have mosquitos at the Italian a la carte one night - but otherwise none).","date":"2012-03-09 21:13:12 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":3,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":4,"Value":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.viridianhousing.org.uk\/find_a_home\/short-stay-accommodation\/hostels\/Park%20House\/index","vacancy":false}

Stayed there from Dec 26\/06 to Jan 2\/07. I have been to Punta Cana once before at an excellent resort, and my wife has been to several resorts in Punta Cana and Puerto Plata, as well as Acapulco, Mexico, etc. I regret that there is a lot of negativity in this review, I still had a great time in spite of the resort (thanks to the weather, the beautiful beach and my 16-mo. old daughter's laughter).First the good stuff:I liked the rooms, the resort grounds are beautiful, the food at the steakhouse was very good and the New Year's Eve dinner was also very good. None of us got sick, although my daughter had a mild bout of diarrhea before we switched her to rice, pasta, water, bananas and some fruit. The staff was pretty good at raking up the seaweed from the beach, but they missed a day here and there. Weather was fantastic, poured like $@!#% most nights and gorgeous breezy days.But...We had all kinds of negative experiences with the service. The staff at the reception desk lied to us without blinking an eye, first about when the rooms would be ready and again about finding a crib for our daughter. In my opinion, it appears they are trained to tell you whatever you want to hear so you will go away and stop bothering them. While the clerk I was speaking with insisted she never said to come back for our room keys at 2:30, that check-in time is 3, the clerk beside her was having a similar conversation, insisting with a smile that he told my fellow traveller that keys would be ready at 3:30. This made my clerk a little uncomfortable, since they were both telling different stories. Others from our flight (arrived in PC at 10.30am) didn't get their room keys until 5.30pm.On check-in (1pm) we asked a crib for my 16 mo. old daughter. At 8.30pm when we didn't have one yet, I went to the front desk to ask for one, and was told we would have one in 20 minutes. 90 minutes later I went back to the front desk and asked where it was, could we go to housekeeping and find one. The same person behind the desk explained to me that a crib wasn't part of our reservation. I lost it. I realize now that their blank stares were indications that they simply didn't understand what I was asking. Eventually they said they would try and locate one, and the manager (? - could have been anybody since he didn't identify himself) said he would call us in the room to make sure we got one. He never called. An hour later I found one in a hallway and carried it to our room. When we related our frustration to the Sunwing tour rep, he went and talked to the front desk, returned and apologized on the behalf of Natura. He also said they would make it up to us with some sort of detail - a bottle of rum or something. Nada, never heard from them again. All this on our first day.Language barriers abounded; I fully appreciate that Spanish is the native tongue, but keep in mind I wasn't backpacking in the Dominican - this is an all-inclusive and, to some degree, you rely on the staff to make the effort to help you have a good time. I had no such problems at my last resort (Bavaro Princess). Nada from this resort. I did the best I could with Spanish, but when I had to rely on English to try and ask\/explain something, I didn't get anywhere with anyone.Bellhops, waiters, bus staff, bartenders, some housekeepers - nobody wanted to do more than the bare minimum. There was even some rudeness. We gave up asking for cutlery\/napkins\/coffee refills: it was so much easier to wander around La Cana (the main buffet rest.) until you found it yourself. Twice I had to go hunting for towels because the housekeeper forgot us. On one of those occasions, I called the front desk, tried to explain that we had no towels, they said they would take care of it. An hour later a maintenance guy showed up to fix the door. (--?!) Thankfully, he had a key to the housekeeping linen closet and brought us two bath towels. The wind frequently blew debris into the pool from the beach restaurant. As the day went on, I was surprised that no staff came along to clean it up. Paper napkins, bits of food, dirt, etc. accumulated at the two ramps leading into the pool (The ramps are great for toddlers!). The foot-washing showers to remove sand were broken. Lots of sand in the pool. I developed a sinus infection and my daughter a mild eye infection. Hard to say if it was from the pool, but I don't know where else either one of us would have picked it up.A friend we met on the plane to Punta Cana got violently ill - food poisoning - on his last meal before getting on the plane home. Poor guy spent the entire trip locked in the bathroom, paramedics waiting for him at the airport.There are better resorts for the same money. I'm willing to bet there are better resorts for less money. If you are desperate enough to get away and have to go here, then I hope you have no issues on your trip, otherwise you will be challenged to get any help: expect to fall between the cracks. Everyone else that I met (Canadians, French, Polish, Czech, German, Italian) all told the same familiar story. They said they wouldn't go back either. Sunwing will be my last choice for future trips.","date":"2012-11-07 20:38:35 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":1,"Cleanliness":3,"Location":4,"Overall":1,"Rooms":3,"Service":1,"Value":1}},{"author":"Mitchel Beatty","content":"Engaged on the beach! What a great vacation! And for the price... you just can't beat it! My boyfriend and I went to Natura Park from January 20-27 of 2006. He soon became my fiance... because he proposed to me on the beach on our very first night! The resort is beautiful, full of plants and flowers and wildlife. The beach is beautiful too- I had heard that people were turned off by the seaweed, but there really was very little seaweed in the water. There are maintenance staff who sweep it off the beach- I did not think it was a problem at all. The pool was very clean and very large! We really enjoyed getting pina coladas at the swim-up bar! There are not a lot of kids there, which is something that we wanted. It was 95% adults, very few children. For us, that was a good thing. The food was very good... but it is not americanized at all. So chinese food is not exactly what you're used to... but if you have an open mind, I think you'll enjoy it. We had dinner at all three restaurants, steakhouse, Italian, and seafood- and they were all great! My favorite was the seafood. We had a great week, got very tan, ate good food, enjoyed pina coladas and bahama mamas... relaxed a lot... exactly what we wanted. We took an excursion to the capital of the DR, Santo Domingo, and that was really interesting and fun. It was neat to see the city and the culture of the residents. We really had a great week, and...we liked it so much that we are thinking of going back this fall for our honeymoon! If you are looking for very relaxing, mellow vacation... this is for you. If you want a crazy spring break\/nightlife vacation, this would not be it.

This resort has stunning landscaping and scenary anywhere you go. The ocean is breath taking and the walk down the beach to the left of the resort is unforgetable.

This country has some of the happiest people going about their busniess, asking Don't you just love our country? When will you come back again???When I try to compare the Dominican to Mexico, The Domincan WINS. I shed a tear as my taxi pulled away from the resort. My only warning to furture travelers is don't eat the lobster, and don't use the mini-bar. If you can afford go on the tours sold by the vacation providers or have fun bartering at the markets!!!

In this resort, you can find a beautiful natural environment, wild birds , very quiet and clean rooms, great and friendly people (even though not all staff speak English, however, all of them are willing to make your vacation enjoyable). The beach is beautiful with white sand and you can walk forever. There are no vendors harassing guests on the beach. The water is clear and the beach is well maintained with plenty of lounge chairs. There were the usual resort activities: volleyball, water polo, some meringue lessons.On the other hand, in our experience there are many things that the management could improve and make this a 5 star Resort. For example: If you like alcoholic beverages be prepared to drink a lot because in my opinion the bottles are diluted with something, but I am not sure. Some wine was poured from a large white plastic bleach container!If you purchased all inclusive package you have the right to have a la carte dinners in each of the 3 restaurants, my advice; if you drink wine (red or white) purchase your own at the Duty Free because the Spanish house wine that they serve with the meals is terrible! The food was better than the buffet, but in this resort, food and drink is not the highlight.Talking about the buffet, in my personal opinion, in general its ok. Some of the meals in the buffet were very greasy, and very salty, and the seafood is not great as I expected. We were a little sick after eating seafood but we are not sure if the seafood was the cause. However, be prepared and take a big bottle of Pepto Bismol with you (helps). Another good piece of advice is; bring small bills in American dollars because it is very difficult to change large bills for small ones. Tip your room maid the first day and you will get plenty of water, coffee, beer extra towels and changed linens when you want. There is a spa on site, (extra charge) the mud massage (called fango) was great. 3 clay tennis available. After spending a week in Natura Park, I found our time was enjoyable, we had a good time in a beautiful place, and people were very hospitable. However, I won鈥檛 come back there, I will try another resort in the Caribbean next time.","date":"2014-10-01 07:25:49 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":3,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ambassadors-hotel.co.uk\/","vacancy":false}

Our minibar was replentished every day with Pepsi and beer and it kept our water cold. We had a nice balcony to sit and have morning coffee or an early evening drink. We did tip our maid and leave some small gifts daily. The only problem we found was before the disco closed they tended to turn up the music for about half an hour. When we asked guest services about this he laughed and said he did not even know they had a disco.The food was good but not great. There was no need for you to go hungry as there is plenty of choice. My wife is a picky eater and she always had something she liked. They do have to make more of an effort to serve food that is hot.

I had ready all of the reviews I could get my eyes on before we left, and I have to disagree with many, many of the complainers I read about. Yes, there was a bit of seaweed here and there and more on certain days, etc.; however, nothing overwhelming and certainly nothing to stop me from enjoying wading or swimming in the water. The buffet for breakfast and dinner did leave a bit to be desired, but I still managed to pack on some pounds, so there must have been enough to keep my hunger pangs from being outrageous - that and the constant food display down by the pool\/beach throughout the day. When we first arrived, our room was not was we requested (not a King bed), but once we found out and told them that's not what we asked for, next thing we knew, we were in our King-bed room.We didn't understand a whole lot of the people around us as we were minority speaking English, and found that to be the perfect thing for relaxing. We knew enough spanish to make our way around, as well as found several other couples who too spoke English if we really felt we needed to rattle off a conversation with someone other than ourselves and the excellent bartenders who were always fun to try and communicate back and forth with (by the way - Jose down at the beach bar is the man you need to see - a little Mamma Wanna each night and you'll be set). The resort is perfectly located down from a shopping area, as well as it offers snorkeling, horse-back riding, parasailing, sun bathing, exercise, sports, and there are reps who offer taking a boat to other places to get dinner and\/or do shopping elsewhere. I recommend the Lobster\/seafood place (Langosta del Caribe) about 15 minutes down the beach by boat - fabulous food, more shops to see (inside a little community) and all the drinks you can take in while you sit and dine through a several-course, great meal. It even downpoured while we were eating, and the Cana tree awnings provided all the protection we needed - didn't get a drop on us! We brought the wash clothes as recommended in other reviews, but noticed there is one included in the hotel, it's just a little unnoticeable as it's in the basket under the shampoos, comb, etc. they provide for you... so if nobody ever seems to use it, yeah, I imagine people think the hotel doesn't have them. The room itself was cleaned very well, and the maid was excellent to us - leave a dollar next to the bottle of water and she'll bring you more bottles of water than you can even drink the next day.I highly recommend for buying your jewelry or pictures to take a walk down the beach to the left. There is a man that boats in his stuff daily and sells it cheaper than the gift shop and WITHOUT ANY HASSLE!Only thing I would have liked to see in Natura Park resort that wasn't offered is a disco place. I was hoping to dance a little while I was there, but that wasn't an option.I don't have any other experiences to compare it to as it's my first time being there, but I do know that I would return to Natura Park - great place, great people, great time, great sites.

However i am pleased to say that the hotel gardens and grounds were extremely beutiful. I loved all the flamingoes and geese and wildlife on the resort. The geese seem to attack you and bite you for your food. My family found it quite comical and laughed at the fact of those damn man-eaters that would hang out and bite the people walking by. Ive been down to the carribean as well as Mexico and I thought that the hotel as a whole was well kept and alot of fun. The food is great. Im a picky eater and I still thought the food was better then all the other resorts that ive stayed at. I do have to say the drinks could have been better. THEY dont even put a banana in a banana mama. They seem to have a different method of doing things. The pina coladas were pretty good and your beer and mixes are the same were ever you go. The beach was really great. There are no waves so if you are a surfer and wave rider dont plan this area to ride waves. The waves break out on the reef way out in front of the hotel. The snorkeling could not have been any better. I mean right by the shore there isn't much corel but if you take a boat out for like $10 dollars\/person you go to the coral reef and that is absolutely incredable. Bring in a piece of bread and you will have thousands of fish swarming around you of all different colors. The water is as clear aqua blue as can be. People some what complain about the seawead that washes ashore but it is cleaned up every early morning. If you want all you have to do is walk down the beach for like 2 minutes to the nature park and that is nothing but white sand and few if any weeds.

There is also a laptop with internet connection for the guest's use. We had a good experience with the staff, for the most part, they were helpful. Our room was all white, with the exception of the bright lime green walls in the bathroom. Just a heads up that the sink and shower are in a small open space (no door). The bathroom area was quite tight, but we were fine with it, especially considering the great rate (we booked a special for $45\/night).

I love the location close to Termini (literally a block away) and I think is a great clean, well built new hotel. The room are ultra modern, the beds a great pleasure. This past stay was largely the same, except for a rather bad end to the visit. My complaints are otherwise very limited. First, the TV's 500 channels could afford to have one or two more English channels than CNN and BBC. They started me in an absolutely tiny room overlooking the block with a tram line, and all night the tram kept me up everytime it passed. The staff graciously found me a much more spacious inner room which was marvelously quiet. Even without having any sort of view, I was quite happy with the change. One complaint I have with this hotel is the bath\/shower. There are no handholds, and you have to step WAY up and over the edge of the tub to get into to the rather slick surface to take a shower - still no handholds. They are a very serious accident (plus subsequent lawsuit) away from having new hotel owners, as getting around inside the tub is a very treacherous experience particularly getting out. I found the safest way to do it was slither out like a snake. My real disappointment came from the non-working phone system through which they were supposed to have given me a wakeup call. No ringing phone, I slept happily two hours longer than I wanted resulting in a 50 euro cab ride to the airport rather than a much cheaper train ride. When I asked the manager to help with the cab fare, she shrugged and said \"no, we can't do that\". Very disappointing. Would I stay there again? Probably. Although I certainly won't rely on them for a wakeup call.","date":"2012-02-28 14:22:10 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.exhibitioncourthotel4.co.uk","vacancy":true}

We were (for some reason) upgraded to a suite and I can honestly say it is the best room I have ever stayed in. Room: Suite had a living room with desk and sofa, sliding doors to a seperate bedroom with a massive solid walnut bed with controls for all the room functions on the bedside tables. Bathroom had a huge showerhead and bath and so many items included - shower gel, shampoo conditioner, hand cream, body lotion, manicure set, shaving set, batch salts, scented candle, tootbrushes and tootpast, robles, slippers etc...There was also an illuminating wardrobe and safe. For me, having lovely tea and coffee facilities was a real bonus abroad. There was Twinings tea bags! Service: Excellent. Very polite, English speaking Reception staff and porters. We checked in at about 4pm, went out for the evening and returned at around 10pm to find that our room had been turned down. Towels were replaced, robes folded and milk replenished. Food The restaurant \/ breakfast room was a lovely cosy, contemporary room with a good ambience. There was an excellent variety of breakfast items although I would say the quality could have been slightly better. Tea \/ coffee was brought to the table (although we were forgotten about initially) Location A stones through from Termini Station - the main hub for the train, Metro and Taxis. You can get anywhere easily from here with excellent links to the airport too. Termini is walkable to the main sights (we did) but not completely central. If you want to be really right in the middle of things, opt for a location near the Spanish Step[s or somewhere like that.

Our room smelled of mold. We looked in the washroom and the bathtub had black mold everywhere. It was disgusting. We told the front desk and they moved us to another room (which appeared to be better). The second room, although a bit bigger had the worst plumbing problems; toilet, bathtub and sink were all blocked and we told management a few times to no avail. The bed had a dry blood stain in the sheets. Beyond gross. It was finally changed after we pointed it out. The room in general was dusty and not taken care of properly. The maid forgot to leave clean towels twice and to top it all off, there was an ant colony all over the room. We had to keep our luggage closed. They were everywhere and after pointing out all these problems, management finally sent a plumber and they sprayed for the ants. Would definately NOT stay here ever again. It's not the guests' duty to tell the hotel what is wrong with the rooms. We chose it due to the proximity to the station since we were travelling by train and also because it is a \"new\" property. The food too for breakfast wasn't all that. The same old boring packaged stuff, runny eggs, worst espresso ever. . Being in Rome, I expected more from the food at least.

The staff are all very polite and efficient. In a previous review I had read a complaint about possible noise from the tram line that runs outside the hotel, so I made sure we got a room at the back. This was very quiet and luxuriously appointed with a lovely large bathroom with a bath. The breakfast was very good indeed with a good selection of fruits breads pastries juices and cereals. The scrambled egg and bacon did not look so nice though but the rest was great. There are some nice reasonably priced restaurants near the hotel. I found the hotel to be a little far from the centre to walk so we got taxis everywhere. You can get a train from the airport but we didn’t want the humping of cases on and off the train and through the station. (You are too close to get a taxi from the station just one block down from Termini) So it would have been lugging cases down the street to the hotel. We decided to get a taxi from Fumicino airport. This is fixed rate of 40 Euros which is not bad for the convenience. You have to get a ticket from a desk just before you go out the door of the airport to make sure you get the 40 Euro fixed rate, otherwise the taxi will be on the meter. The Hotel can arrange a luxury car back to the airport for 45 Euro which we took on departure. Impressions of Rome: Visit the main attractions about two in the afternoon to avoid the queues. We only queued for 15 mins at St Peters and the same at the Colliseum. The Vatican Museum we walked straight in. You may as well give the Trevi fountain a miss as it’s just a horde of tourists. The Sistine chapel was fantastic and the highlight of our stay.

Got a nice discount. However when I checked in at the Rome property I was given a very small room which with my son's roll away bed was simply impossible. Returned to the desk and was told nothing could be done went back to the room and tried to rearrange the furniture and it was still not going to work. Returned to front desk and told the rather cold and abrupt clerk that the room was unacceptable period--I was a corporate reservation and requested to speak to the manager on duty. This lady didn't speak English but took one look at the reservation and directed the supercilious desk clerk to put us in a nice two room suite which was great! Thank you very much. The biggest issue most people will have with the hotel is the location--about two blocks from the train station. Not a high rent neighborhood. In fact I watched a homeless guy sit in a doorway across the street for three days and nights. At the historic baths a few blocks away I saw the mobile health service van giving the homeless Heroin addicts their \"treatments\". However, I never felt uncomfortable walking the local streets even after dark and there are some reasonable eateries just around the corner. Being installed in a suite probably skews my review...there was some street noise at night and there is full time security personnel in the lobby to keep out the riff raff but I found it comfortable and convenient with a nice free breakfast. My wife didn't care for the location but even she felt the room was nice--especially with the three of us in it.

Prior to beginning our trip, I had second thoughts about staying here as I realized that there wasn't a lot of information available. In fact, the limo driver (a Roman native) who drove us from the airport to the hotel said he'd never heard of Relais 6 before, or even been to the neighborhood. Fortunately, Relais 6 is an excellent hotel and we had a great stay. Its rather low profile meant that there weren't many other guests, allowing us to fully appreciate its tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean interiors. There were plenty of antiques and old knick-knacks, even a small WWII museum. Room: We booked a standard triple room which felt a little cramped (though the size was probably par for Rome) . Bed and HVAC were good. TV was small and had mostly local channels. Service: Front desk staff were polite and efficient though a bit aloof. Other staff were very friendly and accommodating. Location: Relais 6 is located in a quiet residential area. It's the nicest building along the whole street. There's a pizzeria 5 minutes away by foot (which gets packed during weekends) and there're bus stops a couple of minutes away. It took about 20 minutes to get to Termini station by bus. Overall, Relais 6 offered us great value and I would recommend it to fellow travelers, though I'm also keen to keep it as one of Rome's \"hidden gems\".","date":"2015-01-17 03:14:37 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":4,"Overall":5,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Mrs. Cesar Roberts","content":"If you don't mind, or enjoy being just a bit out of the city center, this is a fantastic hotel.

Comparable to a Travelodge or Premier Inn. The hotel is new, very clean, well run and cheap for Singapore. The location is just 10 mins walk from the nearest metro station, in a central but quiet part of Singapore, only a couple of stops from the main shopping area (taxis are also easy to find and the area is safe to walk around late at night). We didn't have any of our meals at the hotel but there are several \"hawker\" centres around the hotel where you can get tasty local food for a few dollars (the Chicken Rice outlet near Novena MRT station was excellent). We only really used the hotel as a base to sleep, although the pool on the roof was nice for a morning swim. We also got free Wifi, although it was a bit of a hassle requesting a new code every day. Bathroom is compact, so does get a little wet after a shower but this is not really an issue. The rooms are quite small so don't expect much storage space - not a problem if you don't mind living out of your suitcase for a few days.

The hotel is situated a little outside the centre of the city, but this isn't a problem as the Novena MRT station is only a 10-15 minute walk away. There are several local cheap Chinese restaurants on the right-hand side as you walk to the MRT. I would recommend trying them. The hotel is new and in good condition - there is a nice swimming pool on the 7th floor. The room was very small - especially with a young child - but it was new and clean. It was fine for our needs as you don't come to Singapore to spend time in your room. The only complaint I had was that the walls are fairly thin - we could hear next-door's television and people talking in the corridor. The staff were helpful and efficient when you asked them anything. The things I like most about the hotel is that it's cheap, clean, has a nice swimming pool and is in a good location for restaurants and the MRT.

There are several bus stops infront and across the hotel. If you have a bus card, take a 3-min walk to Thomson Rd bus stop and you'll find several buses that'll take you to the nearest mrt station (novena) and to Orchard Rd. By bus, Orchard is only a couple of stops away (10-15 mins). Highly recommended for travelers who are looking for a no-frills hotel.

We celebrated are wedding week at the Ames, my wife and I stayed at the Ames last year, the exact same weekend of the wedding just so we can have an idea how the weather would be so we could prepare our friend and family from Miami, FL. It has been such a marvelous experience working with Executive Assistant Julie Guerra at the Ames, she made all the arrangements and it was a breeze to coordinate everything with her and the hotel staff. In all honesty, they treated our 28 guests like family, there were no complaints just continued waves of compliments from our guests. The rooms are beautiful, clean and modern. The beds are so yummy, it made it hard to get out of bed some mornings. The location is perfect, take the shuttle at the airport to the blue line, and the blue line to state, the hotel is right across the street, you will get there in less than 10 mins. It's only a short drive from the airport, trust me I made several trips this past week. Faneuil Hall is right next to the hotel with plenty of shops and bars, shopping is just down the street, H&M, Macy's and several other stores are just a couple of blocks away. There are trolley tours that can take you around town. The blue\/orange line is on state, and the blue\/green government center line is behind the hotel. Since we needed to apply for our marriage license, city hall was just next to the hotel, less than a five minute walk. There are several banks nearby, and CVS if you need water or other essentials. The hotel is in a centralized location, and easily accessible via public transportation. The minute you get out of the car, the most cordial and helpful doormen, like Nick, Brandon, Ralique (I may be butchering the spelling of his name, sorry) and the other gentlemen who took wonderful care of us, greet you with a warm smile. The concierge Charles is phenomenal, he arranged transportation for our guest to the wedding location a few blocks away, and took care of any logistical concerns we had. My mom and my cousins are in love with him, he is just amazing. The front-desk staff, the amazing Rosy, Mary, Alison, Janelle, Frances, Kimberly, and Ben, they are always there to greet you with a smile, and always taking care of your every need. No reasonable request was every denied, we thank you for putting up with us the days leading to the wedding. Housekeeping is always on point the rooms are always spotless, and well-taken care, extra towels and toiletries are provided within minutes of request and always with a smile and pleasantries. We loved Deanna on the 14th floor; she took excellent care of us the whole week, even our dog Lenny is in love with her. Cecelia, I think she is head of housekeeping, she is an angel, she treated our dog like VIP, and the rest of housekeeping were always patient and kind. Downstairs at the Woodward, great service, excellent food, amazing selection of cocktails, beer and wine, Jake was our main server for the week, he and the manager Dana took excellent care of everyone all week. I donâ€™t think we ate breakfast or dinner anywhere else while in town. Everyone was sad to leave the Ames; no one wanted to go back home. We sincerely thank everyone at the Ames and the Woodward for their incredibly hospitality, they made our wedding week memorable and unforgettable. The Rodriguez Wedding Party!","date":"2014-06-26 13:44:00 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Dana Larkin","content":"Nice hotel, the bed seemed awfully low to the ground, but it was comfy.

The safe in our room was broke but they fixed it while we were out doing touristy stuff. Did I mention that you are less than 20 steps from the 'T' and 2 minutes from Quincy Market\/ Faniell Hall, etc. Charles the Conceirge (aka C.T.C.) was excellent and very helpful for stops to get some snacks and directions. However, the WiFi was not free and for the price I figure they might have it thrown in with the $300+ room fee. Also there is no exhaust fan in the modern designed bathroom so that was annoying after a shower.

The staff at Ames are the most customer service oriented group of folks I've ever experienced while traveling. Nina Sweet (front office manager) and Charles Currier (concierge) played a major role in making our stay remarkale. In the week prior to our arriving in Boston, I emailed Nina to introduce myself and mention to her how much we were looking forward to our stay.. She responded the following day and stated that she had upgraded our room from the standard queen we had booked to a Deluxe King. Additionally, she has provided us with complimentary internet use during our stay, which is allowing me to write this review at no cost.. The pictures posted of the hotel are accurate in that the hotel is very hip and asthetically pleasing to the eyes. Additionally, the room is very comfortable with wood and marble flooring,12 foot ceilings and a window that likely measures 10ft by 6 ft, a 40in flat panel television, very comfortable bed, refridgerator, a safe large enough to store a laptop, complimentary toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, and body wash) and bath robes.

I was charged for multiple nights of parking, when I only stayed for one that included parking. I was charged for items that were previously taken from the mini bar (I did not realize I was supposed to check the mini bar for the hotel when I arrived - they actually said that to me). And then the topper was when the valet would not return my car key, until he received a tip. Even though I had given him $10 on the way in.

I stayed in Hong Kong for 8 days in 3 hotels. The first couple nights I stayed at Marriott near the airport which was pretty good too but very standard room in Hong Kong. Then I stayed one night in Hyatt in grand central and that experience was pretty bad because the hotel is really old and the suite was really small compared to the money spent. The remaining nights I stayed at Uppder House and the experience was EXCELLENT. ROOM: The room is double of the size compared to the regular rooms in most of 4 or 5 star Hong Kong hotels although half of the room is used for bathroom space. I love the free snack and drink bar especially when I returned to the hotel late at night. The Hotel uses \"REN\" skincare products and I LOVE IT! They gave you one cosmetic bag full of REN products everyday even though you don't finish them. I had harbor veiw 70 room and the view is really amazing. I also loved the sitting area next to the huge windows over looking the ocean. I had my coffee and snack early in the morning or late at night looking at the view and listening to the iPod jazz songs the hotel provides. They also provide free wifi. SERVICE: The customer service is amazing too. I had a package delivered oversea and the front desk helped me to track it while I was out. When I returned, it was sitting on my desk already. Anything I asked, they figured it out for me with very professional manner. FOOD: I went to the 49th floor for breakfast and I wouldn't recommend it. There are TONS of good food out there. The breakfast was fancy but wayyyy over priced. LOCATION: Excellent location. It's right next to Marriott and connected to Pacific Place which is one of the stops of subway, but it has the quietness outside of the busy mall. In my opinion, the location is great. The ONLY thing I am a little bit disappointed is Upper House is sort of like an \"Apartment\" not really a \"hotel\", so it gives you lots of comfort feeling of a \"home\", so maybe that's the reason they don't have pool and spa. Therefore, I went to spas at both Mandarin Oriental and Ritz-Carlton. If you don't care about the 116th floors ocean view of Ritz-Cariton, you should consider going to the spa in Mandarin Oriental which is much better. I love their extra facilities and relaxation room. If you are willing to spend a little extra money, Upper House is definitely your choice.","date":"2013-03-22 19:15:18 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Lonnie Rice","content":"I have stayed in many beautiful hotels in Hong Kong, but I wanted something different and exclusive. My friend suggested the Upper House, and I tried. It is located next to Conrad and Marriott, but had a definitely different atmosphere and a bit like a hideaway. The hotel makes you feel like a special person, and they treat you that way with personal attention. Upon arrival, I had reserved a standard room, but somehow they upgraded me to a huge suite. The standard room is already large to begin with, but the suite was huge. I had 8 guests come over to spend in my living room, and we all sat on the sofa very comfortably. The bathroom was surrounded by windows and I enjoyed the panoramic views while bathing. I was told not to forget closing the automatic shades when bathing after dark... The rooms are very simple designed, and thats what I like. But the amenities were very stylish and they even offered playing cards... The mini bar was all free, and they had candys and chocolates, and toilettry kit for takeaway. I loved the bathrobe, so I decided to buy one. There were few areas I found needs improvement. The carpet was stained, and some staffs seemed unexperienced. I had to wait more than 5 ringtones until the front desk answered my call. But all these were covered by all the positive aspects. The real downside for me was that they had no swimming pool and a tiny fitness room, but I was so busy that I did not have time even if they had those features. So if you are bringing children who wants to play at the pool, this is not for you. I was there for business, but I definitely would want to return next for holiday with my wife. They have a nice restaurant called Cafe Gray Deluxe, but I thought it could be better. The hotel is located by the cliffs, and my room had spectacular views of the bay, the city, and the mountains. It is near Admiralty on Hong Kong side, and just 5 minutes away by taxi from the convention center. If you want the hustle bustle excitement of Tsim sha tsui, then I don't think the location is very convenient, but if you want a quiet and peaceful atmosphere, I would recommend the Upper House. Its close to the financial district too, so good for executives on business. The rates are quite expensive, and some writes that its not worth what you are paying for, but even if I was not upgraded, I will still be satisfied with what I paid. The Upper House will be my home in Hong Kong, where I can get away from the crowd and spend time in peace and comfort. It is a hotel that makes you feel very special!","date":"2013-07-10 05:11:08 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":4,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":3}},{"author":"Nia Watsica","content":"I stayed in the hotel for the first time over the New Year.

We only wish we could have spent more time there! Very spacious and we had the lowest end room. Bathroom was amazing with a beautiful bath with great views. Their maxi bar is a great idea - you get free water, beer, soft drink and snacks. Other hotels could definitely learn from this, as well as the free wifi which was reasonably fast. The concierge was very helpful when looking for a place to have dinner but we ended up in the hotel's 1 Michelin starred restaurant - which was wonderful (I'll review this separately). It's definitely one of the best rooms we've ever stayed in and if they had a pool and spa then it would have been one of the best hotels. (There are other hotels close and I think you can get access to their pool - maybe for a cost.) We're already thinking about when we can come back to Hong Kong just so we can stay at The Upper House!

Hats off to the Upper House staff- you are all excellent. The room was impeccable with a large and outrageously comfortable bed, and a large and outrageously impressive bathroom, three huge sofas, an I-pod loaded with music linked to the AV system, and a well-chosen selection of coffee table books- design, fashion and the history of Hong Kong. Forget the minibar- here we had a maxi bar, a fridge full of complimentary drinks (loved the Firefly), an Illy Espresso machine, and jars of cookies, m&m’s, almonds and more. We were also delighted to find full sized “Ren” products in the bathroom. A few drops of the Ren rose oil in the bathtub whilst looking down on Hong Kong twinkling below me- pure heaven. The Upper House is well located within Pacific Place- good shopping and transport, but because we were so comfortable, we deferred and deferred leaving our room reading and playing backgammon instead… We did make it upstairs to Café Gray Deluxe; we had excellent food and wine, and then a drink at the long bar- great views, a great evening!

Large bath \/ shower area with R E N toiletries supplied. The Michelin 1 star restaurant is located on the 49th floor and has views over the harbour which when enjoying dinner includes the daily 8pm light show. Good selection of well presented delicious food. All the staff were very polite and friendly with those at breakfast in particular going out of their way to make us feel at home and we felt they regarded us as friends rather than customers.

A self-confessed Four Seasons Hong Kong junkie, I thought that no hotel could ever match its impeccable service, stunning location, unbelievable facilities and F&B. Boy, was I wrong. Upper House just blew me away - exceeded all expectations and then some. I had more OMG moments in this smallish, stunning boutique hotel in the very convenient Pacific Place than I care to remember. Let’s start with reception: nice and discrete ground floor welcome, warm and enthusiastic without being gushy from an impeccably groomed and professional team. It also smelled gorgeous. We were terribly early (7:30am) and not expecting our rooms to be ready. No problem at all, and a suite upgrade to boot! Immediately whisked away for a comfortable in-room check-in, we had our first OMG moment – the jaw-dropping views of HKG harbour. Then we focussed on the room, HUGE barely describes it. Sprawling more like it, and oh so comfortable. More OMG moments followed – the fit-out and interior detailing all extraordinary. Beautiful timbers, impeccable craftsmanship, easy to operate touch-button controls for everything; brilliant lighting, TV and in-built sound system wiring the iPod to all rooms, including bathroom. A minibar with complimentary beer, soft drinks and juices – there is a God! And oh, what a bathroom – two rooms actually, one with twin vanities and TWO inbuilt dressing tables and stools, separate loo and more space than you’ll every use; then into a corridor, up some broad, flat, LED under-lit stairs to the pièce de résistance, the ‘bath’ room. A free-standing, centre-of-room bath surrounded by picture windows with HKG and its harbour spread beneath you. Covetous REN products complemented this spectacular offering. Tucked behind, a large cubicle with rain-shower seemed almost superfluous but equally inviting. It was then off to Café Gray Deluxe for breakfast and service that was so sharp and on-the-ball it almost made you weep with joy. Highly attentive, knowledgeable and thoroughly accommodating, staff could not do enough. You knew they really cared. Needless to say the food was beyond delicious and the coffee, without doubt, the best in town. We returned later for afternoon tea (book through a Virtuoso travel agent and it's complimentary, as was the room upgrade) and the best I’ve ever had – so contemporary, flavoursome and original it puts all the others to shame. Sorry Peninsular, your high-tea is well and truly trumped here. The adjacent bar proved a knock-out venue for cocktails that evening – very pricey but with the level 49 views and supremely comfortable all-window nooks it was incomparable. The interior design and comfort here and in the café brings more OMG moments. No, there is neither pool nor spa at Upper House, only a small but useful gym. No big deal though - I popped 20m across the road to the Shangri-la to do all that. Great facilities and not the least bit inconvenient. And a pool that almost rivals the Four Seasons’. Upper House was one hotel I never wanted to leave. A flask of warm milk and cookies on turndown was a nice touch but the take-away espresso waiting at 5:45am on checkout really sold me. I’ll return to the Four Seasons when I feel like a resort-type stay, but every other time I’ll be back to Upper House. It was like being in the home you might create in your dreams.","date":"2014-02-08 04:32:16 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Darian Buckridge","content":"In the heart of Pacific Place, lies the Upper House Hotel, being the inaugural Hong Kong Hotel for the Swire group. Just getting to the restaurant is an experience in itself; certainly in the evening the ambiance sets the tone for what’s in store. While modern minimalism is a feature of the Hotel, making ones way up the long sleek escalator with warm teak wood hues gives way to a lift lobby that then takes you to the top floor of the Hotel wherein lies on the 49th Floor Café Gray Deluxe. A short candle lit hall leads to the interior. With the bar and cosy semi private booths on the right and the main dining area straight ahead, the inimitable style and refined aesthetics are both soothing and sophisticated. Service It’s not that hard to build and create a great looking restaurant, however, while one can build and create the most amazing places on earth it takes people to make them a reality. This is where Café Gray Deluxe exceeds expectations. Quality service should always be unobtrusive yet professional and efficient. Café Gray Deluxe is both. More than that, it’s carried out in a genuinely caring manner. Making this a place where casual meets sheik with attention to service. On our visit our service was superb and again proves that in Hong Kong, it is indeed the five star hotels that can attract and retain quality people. Food While there has been “mixed” reports in the media on the food, on our visit we ordered a variety of dishes, all of which were both enticing and delicious. Mixed Oysters with Crab legs (the latter already carefully slice open for easy access) being tastefully presented on a bed of ice, both the Oysters and the Crab were of the freshest and finest. Other dishes to follow where: Pork Chops tenderly cooked with a nice selection of vegetables, a whole Lemon Sole cooked to perfection with a tangy light lemon sauce, and Beef Cheeks, being tender and gelatinous accompanied by a light sauce and medley of vegetables. Now this is were some other reviews had differing thoughts, but my point is this. Good food done well, prepared fresh and with attention to detail is the key to success. It is a simple as that, and while some diners may have different conceptions or follow other fads in reality there is no need for food to be convoluted or complicated. This is where Café Gray Deluxe excels, with quality produce and a traditional approach, neither will never go out of style. Overall it further elevates the dining status for which Hong Kong is famous. Dining at Café Gray Deluxe can be like dining anywhere else in the world and certainly comparable to, Tokyo, London, Paris and New York. No doubt the fact the Chef Gray Kunz, spent sometime at a very successful establishment in New York, evokes a major influence in this dining venue. Personally I can’t wait to go back there!","date":"2014-09-02 09:35:37 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Emile Hermiston","content":"Stayed here for 4 days last week and it was best hotel we have stayed in to date - better than the Wynn, Bellagio, Gansevoort etc. It is easily the best bathroom we have had....

Ben was of the upmost professionalism. The complimentary business center in the lobby was a nice amenity and the internet was high-speed. The breakfast buffet was extremely well run and was constantly being replenished and the tables wiped to allow more patrons to sit and eat. The selection of breakfast food was very good. Our room was a little small as we only had one bed in the room. However, it was more than adequate for our stay and since it is brand new, everything was so fresh and clean. The color scheme and carpeting colors were very pleasing too. The location to the convention center was just one block away and as soon as the JW Marriott opens up everything will be connected by a skywalk. Even so, the walk to the convention center was very close and we even had lots of snow to contend with! There is a busstop right across the street and the Green Zone bus from the airport stops right across from the Fairfield. This made it very convenient since we didn't have the extra expense of a cab. The TGIF restaurant is connected to the Fairfield and we ate there twice. It was so convenient. Great place to stay and very affordable.

The families split the Elysian Suite and I got my babysitter a standard king room. We were all so impressed with the hotel's elegance and charm, and especially by the kindness of the staff. They were always smiling and came to introduce themselves to our kids. The rooms were so comfortable and beautifully decorated. The bathrooms were expansive and modern, and my husband couldn't get over the TV in the mirror. One of the highlights of the trip was the spa. It is one of the nicest hotel spa experiences I can remember, and quite possibly the best massage I've ever had. A few above and beyond things to note. I had asked if we could get high chairs in our suite to feed the kids. Not only were there three high chairs, but it was almost as if they went out and bought brand new ones that day. They obviously had never been used, and they went out of their way to suit our needs. They also brought all of the kids stuffed animals and juice. My babysitter's boyfriend had textbooks in his room and housekeeping accidentally dropped one of his books and tore a page. They called him to apologize profusely, and he wasn't worried about it.

Everything is clean and beautifully appointed. Exceptionally nice linens and towels as well. Service is always with a smile, but many times the front desk seems untrained. However they always are pleasant and willing to help. Also the room service menu is rather slim. Not usually important as there are so many wonderful restaurants in Chicago, but it matters if you must eat in for any reason. Also the pay per view movie selection is terrible. They must have had some complaints about that as they do have DVDs and players available through the concierge. Another area that is less than perfect is the lighting system. I never got the hang of it, nor did my travelling companion. Lights would go on and off at odd times and were hard to adjust to our preferences.

The whole setting is what makes this place special. It was built in 1858 as a coffee plantation house and during the last three decades it's being operated as a parador or bed and breakfast. It's currently operated by the municipality. The staff in general is very kind. The service is nice; the food is what you would find at any puertorrican middle class home. Home style food. Generous portions. Don't expect food cooked by a chef; it's cooked by local women, that cook the same way they cook to their families. Nothing fancy at all but with very nice flavor. The rooms are not in top condition aesthetically speaking but are very clean. They have cable TV. I went with a group that took the whole place for us, and had a blast there.

It is an old hacienda, NOT a hotel, up in the central mountains of Puerto Rico. The views are spectacular! At night, it gets cold--cool breeze from the mountains, ahhhh! We had a huge balcony and would come out at night to relax and drink beer! We were serenated by an orchestra of bugs. It was like being in the middle of a jungle. It was GREAT!!!!! This place is for couples and mature people. Don't bring any kids or immature adults here. Both breakfast and dinner are included and they are both very good. I would recommend the omeletts for breakfast and the chicken asopao for dinner. Our two hosts, Miguel and Juan Carlos, were excellent! They made sure we were enjoying our meal and would accommodate all requests made. Therefore, although tipping is included, we tipped them. Orlando at the front desk could not have been more accommodating. He gave me precise directions to get to the Hacienda, he changed us to a great room because our initial room was leaking water from the toilet, and he even helped us with our bags. I noticed that the people of Jayuya are very proud people. When we went into town and asked people on the street for directions or for the nearby sights, they would stop and very enthusiastically tell you what you needed to know and then they would ask you if you visited this or that other place in Jayuya, and they would tell you what the site meant to them and give you directions on how to get there. Very nice, friendly and decent people. More so here than at other places we have visited. So, my advice to you is treat people with respect and you'll have a far better time. Like others have recommended, I also advise to get here from Ponce (Route 10) even if you come from San Juan. Last year, we took the north route (Route 149), and although you'll see some great mountain panoramic views and small waterfalls, it will take you more than 30 minutes through very narrow and winding roads--it's mountain driving!--and you could get sick.","date":"2014-11-01 14:06:01 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Kevon Collier Sr.","content":"I generally love historic lodges in rustic settings, but this property is simply not worth the trouble to get to. I reserved it after being told by the Frommers guidebook that it was close to the Rio Camuy Caves (a worthwhile stop). It wasn't. After an almost 2 hour grueling journey through amazingly twisty roads, we arrived. The lodge building itself is atmospheric, but the rooms are spartan (and you'll likely be sharing it with a mosquito or two). The kitchen tries -- but generally fails -- to deliver high quality food. There are apparently some walks available from the hotel, but they were inaccessible the night of my stay due to a gate being padlocked. One of the two pools was also closed for repair (the other pool was really too icy to be attractive). At least the drive south to Ponce from the inn only took about an hour. The bottomline is that this property isn't nice enough to make it worth the journey. If you want to see what a historic coffee plantation is like, sign up the the Conservation Trust's tour of Hacienda Buena Vista, just a couple miles from Ponce.","date":"2012-01-26 17:53:09 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Overall":3,"Rooms":2,"Service":3,"Value":3}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.lunasimonehotel.com\/","vacancy":false}

We were looking for a quiet getaway and we got it. If you want a fast paced casino and beach experience, stay in San Juan and pay a fortune. If you want tranquility, golf, beautiful pools and ocean and a staff that is truly glad you are there, go to the Hilton Ponce Golf & Casino Resort. I suspect most complaints are because the guests were expecting plush urban American facilities. We got a great price for unlimited golf and breakfast. The rooms were great - tile floors, very comfortable beds and quiet, except for the ocean and birds. We loved it. In fact, we wish we were still there. We played about 36 holes of golf every day and had the wonderful golf course almost to ourselves. We went in to Ponce often for dinner and exploring. It was a lot of fun. The golf staff was fantastic. For that matter, all the resort staff were superb. Sancho's Sushi Bar was the only disappointment - food was not good and prices were too high. Coming from San Francisco and Washington DC we have great sushi restaurants. Sancho's could use a rehab. The La Cava restaurant was excellent - food was delicious and properly prices. The waiting staff were fantastic. The La Terraza restaurant was our morning oasis - an outdoor breakfast by a lagoon filled with fish and turtles, plus a great view of the ocean and the pool. What a great way to wake up every morning. The beach is not an idyllic beach, but it is a typical Caribbean beach. I recommend snorkeling on the reefs with Caribbean Images Tours (http:\/\/www.caribbeanimagespr.com\/caribbeanimagespr.com\/Welcome.html) . David Mansfield and his first mate Jorge are great guides. You'll have a fun and safe ecotour of the nearby reef. The 27 hole golf course is fairly new and a stern test when the winds come up in the afternoon. There's plenty of water so bring lots f balls for your first few rounds. Once you get your club selection and routing figured out you will be OK. A few fairways are a little rough due to either too much or too little water, but don't hold that against them. The bunkers were pretty much unplayable, but who cares. Take a drop and have fun. There are lots of birds and iguanas to entertain you along the way. The exercise facility is too small for the size of the facility and could use an expansion and equipment upgrade.","date":"2015-05-18 15:40:10 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":4,"Overall":5,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/sanctuaryhousehotel.co.uk\/","vacancy":false}

Sometimes the mixed drinks at the pool side bar are weak and more of a fruit juice drink - a minor problem - and once in a while it is hard to find anyone from the bar checking the pool area to see if you want a snack or drink.

From in-house reservations tocheck-in staff to the breakfast chefs, to the restaurant and bar staff, to room service, cleaning staff, etc - always welcoming and helpful. They put in a lot of effort to make your stay enjoyable and I think this is what puts the Ponce Hilton a step above other hotels.

This was not the worste stay ever at a hotel, but not my favorite! Here's the goods and bads: Goods: Location is amazingly beautiful, but pretty far from San Juan airport. The pool deck looks just like the pictures online. The view from our room (the cheap room) was outstanding. There was one waiter (Izac) who was friendly and one manager (Angel Hernandez) that was helpful when we were having a particularly hard time getting some lunch. Downtown Ponce has a trolley tour that only costs $2 (and for 2 dollars is was pretty good). Our trolley driver was very funny! It was easy to park at the Hilton and the beach towels were pretty big and soft. The lounge chairs at the beach were greatly appreciated and used daily! The breakfast buffet looked pretty good. I ordered eggs Benedict one day (as I don't eat enough buffet for the cost) and it took 1\/2 an hour and my eggs were almost hard boiled they sat around so long. The strawberry daiquiri is very delicious at any time of day, however. The tuna wrap was pretty good and we ordered it a few times (although it was supposed to come with guacamole and it never did. I assume they were out, but a waiter should have said that when we ordered). Bads: There was not once when the food service was good! Over done food that took half an hour or more to bring out (even if we were the only ones waiting) was the norm. If there are spanish speakers around we found they ALWAYS got served first, even if your order was taken first. Waiting 15-20 minutes for a waiter to even acknowledge you was the norm. Several times I was at the bar and the bar tender would go around to all the spanish speakers before me, even if I came first. It often seemed as if the staff didn't really want to be working and they were taking it out on the patrons. My husband and I have been to jamaica several times and we understand island time, but taking an hour for a fruit salad and then not understanding why I get upset when it doesn't come is a little ridiculous! (By the way when the bar tender asked the waitress, who was talking, where the fruit salad was she gave him some attitude, rolled her eyes and walked away to talk with her friend a few feet away). At one point the credit card machines were down and my husband (and the rest of the army boys, we were there with the army) had to get to a meeting. Instead of telling us the machine was down the restaurant took the credit card and just held onto it for twenty minutes. When someone asked if they could get their card back because they had to get to a meeting, the waiter said no. He was going to hold onto the credit card for hours. This might have been an ok option if they had asked but just taking the card and not telling us what was going on was deceitful! We asked them the put the charge on our room and give back the card but they acted like we were asking them to move heaven and earth (I guess it's a lot of work to put something on the room). I try to be polite, but I feel like it was fairly one ended. We went to the casino one night and along with comp. drinks there was grilled cheese. We saw a bunch of spanish speakers going up to the waitress and grabbed sandwiches that were stacked up. (They people had just walked in so I don't think they pre-ordered). When my husband and I walked up and asked for one, the waitress turned away from us and walked the other way without saying a word. Also, bring your own sun screen! A 3 oz container of SPF 35 cost 13 dollars!! And don't ask the ladies in the gift shop for any help, they will only give you attitude and big sighs. The concierge was helpful in the sense that he gave us a map to get to downtown, but suggested nothing to do\/ see\/ or eat while down there. I often felt like I wanted to apologize for asking the staff to answer basic questions or bring out food. I understand it was hot and they didn't want to move fast, but I always say please and thank you and I don't think I deserved all the sighs and eye rolling that I got. It was exactly like telling my teenager to clean her room. The beach did not have the Caribbean clear water that we are used to and it was really rocky for the first five feet, but the waves were safe to play in for the kids. You did have to watch for big rocky wholes in the sand under the water that could cut up your feet but we soon learned where they were and were able to avoid them! I was fairly on my own with a teenage daughter because my husband was in P.R. with the army and although the army told me that everyone in P.R. speaks some english I did not find that to be true. We were very glad when we moved on to San Juan for the next portion of the trip!!","date":"2015-06-25 16:43:18 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":3,"Overall":2,"Rooms":4,"Service":1,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":1}},{"author":"Pasquale Jacobi","content":"After staying in a scrappy hotel in Aguadilla \"La Cima\", this is heaven.

However, first I think it would be helpful to say a few words about Puerto Rico in general and Ponce in particular. We visited Puerto Rico many years ago. In those days, Puerto Rico was very poor and frankly depressing. We chanced a trip back to San Juan about a year ago. I couldn't believe the difference. We have traveled extensively in Latin America â€“ our most recent trip being to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, where they definitely don't have their act together. Puerto Rico is a clean, prosperous and safe place to visit. It is heads and shoulders above anywhere else in Latin America we have ever visited. In Puerto Rico everything works â€“ click, click, click. It is the only place in Latin America I know about where you can drink the tap water and eat the vegetables wihtout wishing you hadn't. You can trust the police. Bribes are not the tradition there. They use American money. Very good English is widely spoken. There were many times I could not hear a trace of an accent. It seems like nearly everyone drives a late model car. Both times we visited there, the weather was perfect â€“ low eighties in the middle of the winter. I saw no beggars on the street. American stores and restaurants are everywhere. You don't need a passport to get there. Our Sprint cell phones had free roaming there â€“ I can't tell you what a convenience that was. We could call each other when separated and our teenager when she wandered off. We could call businesses and have them tell us how to get there. Our teenager sat out on the balcony and talked to her friends back in the United States for hours. We liked our stay in San Juan a lot during our last visit. We stayed in the Hilton there as well, which we also liked a lot. We decided to go to Ponce and stay there for four days just to see something different. There were three of us â€“ two adults and a teenager. The only hitch we ran into is that we had booked a connecting flight from San Juan to Ponce on Cape Air with CheepoAir.com. We had an itinerary from CheepoAir that said we were booked on that flight. Cape Air stated that CheepoAir had canceled our flights â€“ something never mentioned to us and something we certainaly never ordered or agreed to. However, Cape Air said they could get us on that flight, but it would cost a lot, lot more than the advance purchase fare we had booked. I don't know who made the mistake, but I do tend to get little a suspicious of profitable errors. Anyway, it worked out just great. We declined and walked right down to Hertz. The rental for the car for four days, including tax, was $148, which was much less than the original air fare for the connecting flight for one person, let alone three. Except for a short stretch in San Juan, it was all turnpike (about $6 in tolls each way) and a lovely drive through rolling hills. It took less than an hour and a half. We arrived before our scheduled three hour layover in San Juan was over and we had the use of the car while we were in Ponce. The total gas cost was $28 for the round trip and our running around in Ponce. The hotel charged something like $5 a day to park there. Now to the Hilton Ponce. The bottom line is that we liked it. We stayed in a part of the hotel called the Executive Tower. You get a substantial discount on the room rate if you pay in full in advance, which we did. The room was spacious and clean. There were two double beds in the room. I wouldn't call the beds roomy, but they were adequate. We had a balcony that looked out on the ocean. There was a desk in the room. They wanted nearly ten dollars a day for a high speed internet connection. They had an Executive Center where you could get a free wireless connection. Swiping my room card at the door to get in would not work there, but the people on duty always quickly buzzed me in with a smile. The last evening I was there, however, the lady on duty told me that I had to be a Hilton VIP member to use that room. There was nothing on the door to that effect and I saw no mention of that in the guest guide in the room. While that rubbed me more than a little wrong, I have to say the lady was very apologetic and nice about it. The grounds were beautifully landscaped. However, Ponce is not a beach destination. The hotel did have a narrow beach, which did not have a life guard and suffered from some liter. The pool is very nice. The food, while a bit pricy, was outstanding. You can figure on about $35 a person for supper, after taxes, but before tip and about $25 a person for lunch. I don't think Ponce is famous for its restaurants. We ate at several guide book recommended restaurants in Ponce. They were okay, but the food at the Hilton had us spoiled. Most service personnel spoke English very well and they were very polite. Twice the maid forgot to leave coffee for the coffee maker in our room, but both times I called the front desk and a clerk showed up at our door almost at once with the coffee packs. Once the toilet stopped up. I called the front desk and a guy showed up in a flash to fix it. Everyone went out of their way to be friendly. Plenty of security. There are uniformed security guards wandering around all the time. Ponce has a nice little square downtown, surrounded by nice shops. It's hard to find a place to park there. I had to park the car a couple of blocks away and walk, but that wasn't much of a problem. They have some sort of a shuttle bus there to get around the downtown area, but we didn't use it. There is also a nice boardwalk along a harbor with several local restaurants close to the hotel. It's a nice place to go for a stroll, especially at night. We ate at one of the restaurants on the boardwalk, but it did not impress us. Ponce is a nice. well kept little town, but you run out of things to see pretty fast. It's worth a few trips into town, but we spent most of our time at the Hilton, where there is plenty to do. We arrived back to San Juan in our rental car hours before our mid-afternoon flight. We drove out to a part of San Juan called Condado for a leisurely lunch, which we enjoyed immensely. Condado is a tourist area in San Juan close to Old Town that has quite few really nice restaurants. It sure beats air port food, if you have the time and a car to get there. In short, I highly recommend Puerto Rico, Ponce, the Ponce Hilton and Condado in San Juan. I also recommend that you rent a car to drive to Ponce rather than taking a connecting flight.","date":"2015-04-26 16:16:28 +0300","ratings":{"Overall":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.guoman.com\/hotels\/united_kingdom\/london\/the_grosvenor_hotel\/index.html","vacancy":false}

Also, I want to clarify that we spent a lot of nights in non-chain type hotels, so we know how to survive without the standard curved shower curtain, or the standard Hilton Brand alarm on your night stand.... but the experience at At Wind Chimes was so terrible that I really need to talk about it. My wife booked 3 nights at At Wind Chimes 1 month in advance, and when she called the hotel to confirm a crib, she was told that we would be upgraded to the Acacia- wonderful! Call before arriving to know where to check in, they warned her. We got to San Juan, called and found out that the upgrade was fake â€“ back at At Wind Chimes we were! We got to At Wind Chimes. Check in was already troubled by this reverse upgrade, or downgrade. Owner denied any upgrade had ever been offered, and he told us that there are 4 different hotels in San Juan owned by the same owner of the At Wind Chimes. Acacia is right down the road, and is one of these co-owned hotels. Trust me, it is not even in the same category as At Wind Chimes. The look of the hotel is overall Caribbean authentic, at least from the outside. Some renovation was going onâ€¦not very convenient considering the Spring Break period. According to the owner the hotel was full. The swimming pool is in a corner next to the reception.. not very good looking. Not very inviting. Since we were traveling with a 9 month old baby, my wife had called ahead to make sure there was a crib for the baby. Our room at the Acacia was supposed to have a balcony (perfect for when baby went to bed). Our room at At Wind Chimes- not so much. No balcony, no space, very tiny room. We were so disappointed. First of all they asked us to provide the credit card to pay the whole amount. We thought it was for any incidentals, but then we were handed a receipt to sign for another payment. But hey- we already paid in full on Expedia! No, according to At Wind Chimes, we didnâ€™t. (We later checked online- yes of course we had, and we had to repeatedly ask for a refund). Our room was the very last one available (that's what they said). Our room was on the 2nd floor of the 2nd building. After 3 ramps of stairs (no elevator, but they have ground level rooms if you have mobility issues), we finally got to our room. The room was 10' x 10'. Air conditioner under the window 2' from the bed (great for my back...), the room smelled like mold, and it did not look very well cleaned. But the greatest surprise was that the restroom did not have a door (!?!?!) and the window of the bathroom was actually looking at the corridor where all the guests where passing by (the window could not be closed, and we realized quickly that you could hear everything going on in the bathroom from the outside...) The crib was first placed in one position, then moved to another to allow us to access the bed. With the baby, luggage, and us, it was like a puzzle... The smell of mold was still there by the way. Off course there was no balcony eitherâ€¦ so after 7:30 PM, our day was practically over. We had a stained pillow (replaced), dirty towels in the bathroom (replaced). At Wind Chimes really feels more like a hostel than a hotel. Just dirty, unkept and old in general. Internet connection was related to the Boat Bar which is part of the hotel. Connectivity was very poor, and worked only the first day. Speaking of the bar, it was closed for renovation. The carpenters were working from dawn to dusk and everything was happening right in front of our only window. You want to relax in peace, enjoy your time away, have a baby that takes naps? Tough. It was also very noisy with the traffic outside. Remember the window in the bathroom facing the corridor? The corridor has a large opening on the street, that was working as a funnel for all the noises that were easily entering our room every time of the day (and night). The smell of mold was still there by the way.. no matter how low you were trying to keep the air conditioning hoping to reduce the humidity.. it did not work at all. The safety of the room was extremely poor. The same key was opening too many doors... and the lock was very weak. We complained with the owner, but off course the answer was always the same: \"We are trying to find you a better room, We are fully booked, We are sorry, but no refunds...\". The second day I decided to go with our baby to the swimming pool. As I said the one at At Wind Chimes is not very inviting, but the owner told us that if we want we could go to the sister hotel (the Acacia), I decided to go there to see how it looks. The Acacia is a totally different story. No Smell of Mold (off Course!) and very beautiful. The swimming pool (that is actually a very large hot tub) is on the second floor. Once I saw the hot tub I could not believe that both hotels were actually owned by the same person... The Hot Tub is amazing! It is worth the fare for the hotel just by itself... luckily I found that it is not a real hot tub.. it is just a little bit warm.. Perfect temperature for the baby! We had a wonderful time. I had occasion to look into the rooms facing the pool while the doors where open for the cleaning. They have a big LCD, and very nice paintings. The doors are new, and the lamps are new as well. Very good looking, and very nice style. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, I had to go back to the smell of mold, the small room, and the air conditioning hammering my back all night long. A very good thing of the hotel is the location. You are 5 minutes walk from Kasalta Bakery (wonderful for snacks, breakfast, lunches), and many other small restaurants for the night. 10 minutes to the west, and you are in the center of Condado with hundreds of restaurants and bars. The bus stop is 5 minutes from there. Line #53 will take you straight to the old San Juan (amazing place!). The beach is literally 1 minute walk to the north. You can see the palms or the water at the end of the street. Again, let me reiterate- when I read negative reviews on TripAdvisor, I always think: these people expect too much, they are snobs, etc. However, this is unfortunately my true experience as an absolutely normal person. The level of decency is severely lacking at At Wind Chimes. Of course, as long as you do not like the smell of Mold! In that case, the At Wind Chimes is the perfect place for you! We were very happy to leave the At Wind Chimes to continue out trip around the wonderful island of Puerto Rico.","date":"2014-06-11 15:08:58 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":1,"Location":3,"Overall":1,"Rooms":1,"Service":1,"Sleep Quality":1,"Value":1}},{"author":"Miss Price Von","content":"MY partner and I needed a little get away and we chose this place based on a friend's recommendation. We are used to staying in Bed & Breakfast type accommodations and this was more hotel-like so it didnt meet our expectations regarding personalized service. Most of the desk staff was nonchalant and not especially friendly. The rooms were classic Caribbean with spartan furnishings and not up to US mainland standards for cleanliness...especially B & B standards of cleanliness. Loved being at the pool. It was a nice haven after being out in the hot PR weather all day. The \"sister\" hotel which was a block away had a huge hot tub available to Wind Chime guests. It was fun. There is supposedly a happy hour at the bar. We check several times while we were there at the designated time and no one was manning the bar. Not a critical thing.. but they shouldn't promote it. While some people would find this an okay place and we would consider it again, I believe we would likely try another accommodation before returning.","date":"2014-10-05 21:57:46 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":2,"Overall":3,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":3}},{"author":"Adolf Zulauf","content":"We stayed here one night on our way to a cruise.

We got a VERY small room next to the lobby, which made sleeping challenging (for me-my husband sawed logs all night.). Folks we were traveling with got an enormous room upstairs, so they are not all so small. The staff was friendly and helpful enough, but the surfaces of the rooms and bathrooms were not very clean.

After a request they did everything they could to upgrade us for a small charge and move us to the blue room which has a canal view. The room has a four poster bed luxurious curtains and space to move. It has windows that open on to the canal and has double glazing so you don't hear a thing at night. A beautifully decorated room. The hotel is close to some very nice restaurants and the staff are full of helpful hints. We had breakfast (delicious and plentiful) and drinks at night to watch the sunset on the little deck. A fabulous place to watch the venetians go about their daily business. The hotel is very close to several public ferry stops and we booked a private boat to take us to the airport, a little pricey (A$100) but we saw another side of Venice and it surely beats dragging suitcases to buses etc. Overall we highly recommend this hotel for its location, staff and cleanliness.

When we were shown to our room we just looked at each other, speechless â€“ it was stunning. Having spent many hours planning our holiday and making all the bookings this was a very satisfying moment. This was our first visit to Venice and the city (and this hotel) took our breath away. It wonâ€™t be our last visit. We were in the room (101) named after Rosalba Carriera (a female Venetian portrait painter), which had a partial Canal view through one of several windows that opened up on to the adjacent Campo. The location is fantastic â€“ close to the train station (although you would never know it was there), and a 5 minute stroll to either of two Vaporetto stops. The room was luxuriously furnished, with a nice sized bathroom featuring a big bath (which had a canal view!). The bed was very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was a modest affair â€“ not one of their strong points, but if you were lucky you could get a table on the small landing looking out directly on to the Grand Canal. We enjoyed gin & tonics out there one afternoon. There was one free Internet point adjacent to reception which wasnâ€™t too busy. We got a good restaurant recommendation from the front desk and overall the service was very good, especially from Gianni â€“ we would happily have stayed here for quite a bit longer! The hotel is a fair hike from the tourist hot spots like the Rialto Bridge and Piazza San Marco but Iâ€™m counting that as a positive, as it can get crazy in Venice. Thatâ€™s not to say that it isnâ€™t close to a plethora of shops and restaurants, just that you wonâ€™t be over-run in the endless stampede of tour groups. Make sure to visit the nearby gelato shop Alaska â€“ it is legendary. One word of caution â€“ although the hotel is only about 500m from the train station, the Scalzi Bridge is not to be tackled with heavy luggage. My personal trainer will be impressed that I manhandled two bulging 20kg suitcases up and down the 48 steps (I counted them later) but it was a foolhardy exercise. The better option if you have heavy luggage is to pay for a water taxi â€“ damn the expense!","date":"2014-03-05 01:58:10 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Overall":5,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Emmett VonRueden","content":"Giovamme of the Hotel Grand Canal Venice was so amazing, most helpful, friendliest, most courteous staff of this beautiful hotel.","date":"2014-06-17 08:02:57 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Preston Wisoky","content":"My mum, sister and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, we chose it because of the comments on trip advisor and were not disappointed.

The minute I walked out of our private transfer, the service was impeccable! We were guided to our concierge to check in. We were in just awe at the main lobby. The lobby looked into an amazing lobby bar and sitting area with a baby grand piano, and beautiful boutique shops. As we walked outside the lobby bar, the restaurant stretch was to die for!! So many choices and such delightful decor to feel as if you were dining in a romantic upscale dining experience! The ocean from our room was so turquoise. I have never stayed at a place with such an amazing beach. The water was so blue\/turquoise. This has got to be one of the Top 10 beaches in the world. The beach is so wide with soft, white sand. We walked the beach and swam in it every day. You can not feel any rocks or seaweed, just pure white sand. We are not even pool people, but we chose for 2 days to lay out by the pool because it was unlike any other pool you have seen. The service from the moment we got there was a \"WOW\" factor in my book.

My family did go to the pool and found that it was not very sanitary. There were leaves everywhere and there was a group of basketball teams that were staying in the hotel. They sort of crowded the pool area and were a bit noisy--they had won their tournament game so it was understandable. The location of the hotel is great, near restaurants, shopping, fast food places, and pretty much anything that you need. There was a walmart nearby and a walgreens too.

The hotel has clean modern-styled decor and although the rooms are relatively small in size, they are clean, stylish, comfortable, and have all the conveniences that you need.

Hotel is located just off La Ramblas- so that noise of La Ramblas is mitigated. However metro stations and most of the Barcelona sites are within a short walking distance. Our triple room was on top floor with a small balcony- which was a bit of disappointment - as there was no view of La ramblas as I was hoping for. But you can't have low noise and a sight of Ramblas together. Wireless internet signal was solid. Room was clean and compact. It did feel a bit claustrophobic for 3 people, but my comparison is to US hotels. Also, I do not understand why all spain hotels have a small shower curtain extending for 1\/3rd the length - resulting in spilling of water on bathroom floor. Key factors which stand out is the cheerful and customer oriented attitude of service staff at reception. You can ask them for whatever problem you have - right from planning an itinerary, questions abt barcelona, suggestions on icecream shops and SIM card shops in vicinity, availability of tickets to La Musica, US style wall plug adapters to availability of sharpener for daughter's pencils made blunt while recording her journal. Breakfast is nice and wholesome. It was nice of them to prepare it for us at 5.30 am on day of our departure. We took a cab from airport to hotel which cost us 33 euros in evening (meter showed 26 and 7 euros were added on ). While leaving hotel folks called a cab and that cab charged us 49 euros (meter showed 32 euros and 17 was add on charges). Not knowing spanish , I could not argue, but I would suggest confirming the 'add on ' charges before taking a cab - esp if you are doing it at odd hours.

The hotel is in a great location just steps from La Rambla and the metro. The room is a good size as many hotels in Europe tend to have smaller rooms. The front desk is very friendly and helpful with suggestions on good restaurants and local attractions. We found the continental breakfast served in the morning to be a bonus as well. On the negative side, the bed is a cot and a little on the hard side. Also, there is little storage space in the way of drawers or shelves to lay down clothing. The bathroom also has limited shleving for toileteries, etc. It is really a hotel for a very short stay. A word to the wise. I booked the hotel on their web-site and got a very good rate which was non-refundable. Unfortunately, the airline, Air Transat (that's another story) cancelled our flight. So, I had paid for 3 nights but was only able to stay for 2. I did not hear from the manager although the front desk staff told me that non-refundable means that, no exceptions. So, even though it was out of my hands, I was out of pocket for the one night accomodation.

Though being so centrally located, it is surprisingly quiet (and I'm a light sleeper). Hotel offers complimentary breakfast (simple but tasty) and high-speed WiFi. And the best thing about the place is its staff - both reception and kitchen people are extremely friendly and helpful. The best hotel staff I've experienced so far. On the downside - the room is so small, that there's literally no room for proper wardrobe and storage. All I had in my single room was two little drop tables with a shelf (unreachable high) and some hangers above them (which means all the long things you hang will have their bottoms lying on the tables) and a tiny bedside table. That was totally OK for my short visit, but if you're in Barcelona for longer than, let's say\/ a week, you might need a bit more room to arrange your clothes\/shoes and other staff. Besides that, room and bathroom were very nice, new and clean.

The rooms are not soundproof. a) on my second night I could hear a couple arguing LOUDLY in the evening on my floor, in their own room (not in the hall). It went on for at least an hour and the front desk was called by another person on the floor; b) if there are children staying at the hotel, you can hear them - running and screaming in the hall and in the stairwells (while you're in your room) early in the morning; c) people can hear you have loud sex at 3am. I don't care that you're having sex. I care that it's 3am. 2. Realistically, it's a step up from a hostel. It's clean and people are friendly, but don't count on things like an alarm clock or an actual bed (the mattress sits on a metal frame). My bed squeaked every time I moved. Nor should one expect a closet (there's flimsy storage along one wall - shelves \/ rod with hangers). 3. The bathrooms are tiny but bigger than the ones I've experienced in London (UK). My shower didn't close properly and leaked. Nevertheless, the housekeeping staff cleans everything up by 1pm and you have a clean bathroom with fresh towels. 4. There are no 'do not disturb' signs for when you want to sleep in. 5. the breakfast provided was not my favourite (croissant, savoury rolls, cured meats, cheese, 2 types of cereal, hard boiled eggs some days, coffee from a machine, orange juice and yoghurt), however there are few options available in the vicinity with most places opening at 10, if not later. 6. AMAZING location. Steps from las ramblas, the boqueria, two metro stations and plenty of history. There's a bakery a few doors down, great restaurants near by and the Carrefour express is only a couple of blocks away on las ramblas for simple groceries like water and snacks (I wouldn't recommend the Dia grocery across the street from the hotel, they don't have the best selection) 7. Again, really great, friendly staff. The front desk people spoke english and french so it made my stay easier. Also, the housekeeping\/ kitchen staff spoke english.

The elevator (lift) was not in working order and we had 2 full suitcases each, plus hand-luggage because we had just come off of a 15 day cruise. I feel sorry for anyone staying in the room beneath ours because the floor squeaked horribly with every step. The curtains on one window were coming down and did not close completely. The first day we had both hand towels and bath towels; after that we only got bath towels. The bed linens were clean and fresh, but consisted of only a bottom sheet and duvet with cover. The first night was quite warm, so we took the cover off the duvet and used the cover as a top sheet. The bathroom was tiny but clean - and sadly in need of an upgrade - but there was no place to put anything! No hair dryer, and I didn't realize that we could have borrowed one from the front office until I happened to see someone return one on the final day of our stay. There were no water glasses in the bathroom or room, but the night registration desk clerk got us 2 when requested. The next morning, when I asked for 1 more, the dining room attendant rudely addressed my request noting there are not enough for everyone to have a glass. Excuse me! If this location is going to advertise as a hotel, then water glasses in the room is a very minor amenity they should provide - along with hand towels. Desk clerks were very friendly and helpful and even loaned us a converter so we could charge our camera batteries.

When we initially arrived at the hotel we were greeted with a smile and were pleasantly surprised at how much the hotel resembled the pictures in the travel brochures.

I have stayed at many resorts and never have I had a room that was as nice. Two nights when we went to shower there was no hot water, but once again after calling the front desk that problem was looked after. These types of problems are very common with a new resort and hopefully they will have these glitches worked out sooner than later.All of the restuarants were great with lots of selection. You could always get something made on the spot. The only down side to the main buffet was that none of the food was labelled so at times we had no idea what we were getting into.The beach was incredible.

We went to the buffet, followed by a walk on the beach and shortly after 3 pm we were taken to our room (Colonial Junior Suite). A worker was putting last finishing touches on the hot tub area which was not a big deal to us. We had two balconies, one facing the pool and ocean and the other with complete privavcy, comfortable lounger for two and hot tub. Our room was beautiful.That night we discovered switch for lights in bathroom and shower did not work (they stayed on all night). We called in the morning and they were fixed right away. That was the only minor problem we had with our room. A friend staying in Junior Suite also had no problems and a beautiful room. We had buffet for breakfast every day and found the choices to be excellent. The baked items were decadent. We had dinner at the Italian Restaurant twice (lasagna was served stone cold and veal scallopini was dry one night and excellent the other. Aside from that we still enjoyed our meals there. We had a wonderful evening at the Gourmet Restaurant (greeted with champagne) as well as the Steakhouse and the Sea  See (shrimp  lobster) overlooking the ocean. This is where we also ate our lunch every day, which was a buffet with lots of choices and a couple of new things every day. The cakes and baking were outstanding. New Year's buffet was superb. Greeted with champagne at the door and there was everything under the sun on the buffet - it was a real extravaganza. We found all staff to be attentive, friendly and quick to serve. Before going, having read some of the reviews and room problems, I was worried but I can now say that this was one of the best holidays I have ever had (cruises included). The people were excellent and any issues we did have were remedied in short order, including lack of face clothes. Initially, we did not get any in our room but when we asked they were there every day following. Staff are very eager to please. There was champagne and fruit plate in our room on arrival and again champagne to enjoy on New Year's Eve. New Year's eve, there was a band, excellent show, and fireworks. In all, we had an excellent time at the Majestic Elegance. We saw every day, workers ironing out the room and facilities problems but again, we had two rooms and both had no problems that weren't fixed within minutes of letting the front desk know. Would definitely go back.","date":"2015-01-16 22:40:38 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.hastingshotels.com\/slieve-donard-resort-and-spa\/index.html","vacancy":true}

We actually live in Shenzhen - the great city immediately to the north of Hong Kong - but I was leaving for Taipei, so I HAD to stay in Hong Kong before I could go back to mainland after Taiwan, and I didn't book the hotel until 20 days beforehand - well, sorry that's another story. My point is therefore W Hotel was kinda pricy to me (compared to many other non-branded upper upscale hotels in HKG), but it was worth a visit to the leading boutique hotel and the adjacent Elements Mall. $$$$$ was well-spent. The location is great. The hotel is right above the Kowloon Train Station, and it's only 20-30 minutes train (subway) ride from the airport if my memory is correct. Based on my experience, the train still ran at 9:40PM and 5AM. Also, I flew Cathay Pacific to Taipei and got checked in right at the train station, so I didn't have to carry my checked bags to go on the train- I liked it so much. It's connected to the Elements Mall, and I personally liked it better than the Harbor City because it was newer and far less crowded. I had no trouble finding things I wanted that I would be able to get at the Harbor City. Front desk staff spoke fluent English and okay Mandarin. Hotel staff were nice and always greeted us with smiles, especially service people at breakfast buffet. W Hong Kong truly met its service level and my expectations. On the first night, we chcked in late and were lucky to get upgraded to a harbor view double room for two nights. Beds were really comfortable, and I absolutely loved the compartmentalized bathroom. I had never used Bliss before, but in-room Bliss body\/skin-care products totally turned me into a loyal Bliss customer now. Use of technology and decor were very advanced and artsy, but not too overwhelming. Their housekeeping did a good job, too. It has happened to me many times before that your room didn't get fully cleaned if your stay is longer, but everything looked nice and clean again like a new guestroom after housekeepers came in on our second day. I also used their infinity pool. You'll have to try it, if it's your first stay at the W Hong Kong. It was just so good to see all the skyscrapers nearby in your bathing suits on that fancy rooftop. Although I could smell the chemicals, my hair was fine after swimming in the pool. I heared the spa is really good too. Breakfast was good but not impressive, basic Western style. Don't remember if it was complimentary. If I do have to pay next time, I probably won't have it. (228HKD or something). Personally, I'd just prefer to go to some yum dim sum at other cheap places. Come on, you're in Hong Kong. BTW, passed by W Barcelona last week, and it looked so gorgeous - even better than this one. Regret not having statyed there. I'm kinda a W fan now. - 距离香港国际机场搭机场快线很方便。早上5点多和晚上10点左右都还有车。还可直接在九龙火车站就办理手续。 很喜欢圆方，比海港城人少，逛得舒服。东西很全也很高端，也可丰简由君。 海景房很宽敞，浴室很棒。Bliss的产品很舒服。游泳池值得一去。早餐一般，如果要自掏腰包，不划算。 很喜欢这间W, 以后有机会还会去。","date":"2012-03-13 17:53:29 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Thalia Reilly","content":"One of the best places to stay in Hong Kong , Great Hotel with friendly and helpful staff","date":"2012-03-24 00:15:16 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":3,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Mary Barton","content":"Spent the weekend here during a short visit to HK and had an excellent time.

Aside from all the great things about the hotel there's even a airport check-in counter in the same building..

One guy was Billy, wearing big thick rimmed glasses. Couldn't tell whether he loved his job, or was really well trained to demonstrate fun... regardless I really felt the W's cool atmosphere. The Kitchen (name of the buffet restaurant) is really cool too. I am a simple cereal eater for breakfast, but I found my favorite cereals already in a little mason jar. I grabbed an other bottle of milk and a mango juice with the same mason-jar lids. So cool. Only bummer was I was helping run a conference in one of the meeting rooms, and the doors to the meeting rooms are like city gates. Massive and hard to push open! You cannot quietly slip out of the room without heaving the doors open. Ok, I had to say something negative! But that's about it.

The room was spacious enough to ensure we were all comfortable, and everything was of very high quality. The cot for the baby was excellent and the big bed was super comfortable. Amenities were good and everything was fairly functional (though perhaps they do tend to err more on the side of design rather than functionality, but that's ok). Staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. They are obviously well trained and are keen to help customers. Food was fairly good. The only thing to consider carefully is the location. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere but does enjoy very good views of the harbour on one side (though partly obscured by the massive ICC tower) and is close to a shopping mall if that's what you're interested in. Everything is within quick reach by taxi though, and the hotel cars and drivers are also outstanding and affordable. Another odd arrangement is the reception... when you arrive you have to catch a lift to the 6th floor and get out. That's where reception is. Then you catch another lift to the room floors. A bit tiring after a while, especially when travelling with kids (though I'm being picky here). There was wireless internet but it wasn't cheap. Finally, you must check out the pool at the top. Fantastic spot with a stunning view! The pool was closed for a few weeks until January 20120 but is not open again.

The hotel has an internal courtyard with a sensibly-shaped pool and many plants. It gives the illusion of being at a tropical resort with many water features, instead of being at one of the world's busiest airports. Rooms are surprisingly quiet, considering how busy Changi airport is. Rooms are nice - spacious and modern, with large bathrooms, and the hotel designer arranged it so that many of them overlook the relaxing internal courtyard instead of the airport runways. Use of mood lighting in the corridors makes gives the hotel a quiet, subdued atmosphere. The reception area isn't nice though - the morning sun shines right in, and it's - ordinary. The MRT connection makes it easy to connect, but if you're out for shopping or night-life, it's a long way from town!

Also, with the MRT station in the basement, you can move into the city, pretty quickly, without your luggage.

First glitch was in the booking - I had requested twin beds but turned up to be told it was a room with one King bed. This was rectified, but the service was not with a smile at all. The porters were timely, and the rooms are extremely spacious, as expected with 'out-of-the-way' hotels. Its proximity to Terminal 3 of Changi Airport makes it very handy for transitting passengers though. The porters will provide an airport trolley for luggage upon checkout. Our room faced the communal pool, which was not audible from the 7th floor. However, voices of other hotel guests are easily heard from the common corridor. The lighting in the room was rather minimal too, given its size. All in all, a hotel that serves its purpose in providing a comfortable environment close to the International Airport terminals, but is still considered relatively pricey given its location.","date":"2013-06-05 10:28:21 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":3,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":2,"Value":2}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.pembrokeshireholidaypark.co.uk\/","vacancy":true}

Last year I stayed at the Westin (see review). So, I have to admit that this location is definitly MUCH better. Much more within a 3 block radius, including a supermarket, Ralphs. The hotel is brand new. The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms are huge. The pool on the 4th floor is gorgeous, and I LOVED the Illy caffe in the lobby...my favorite coffee place...sure beats starbucks anyday. That being said theres a starbucks within steps from the hotel..as is so many restaurants, and the staples center! Now as far as service...I guess it was fine. Nothing in particular happened for them to demonstrate extraordinary service, but they were always friendly from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. Now I just had 2 complaints. ONE, no free wifi\/internet in the room. Its $12.95 a day!!! I thought this is ridiculous since this isnt a run of the mill hotel. BUT!!!! i found out the way around it! ish! There IS free wifi in the lobby. So you can connect to the wifi in the lobby then go to your room and you have a free hour! et voila! The other thing is that they dont provide microwaves. Now if you are only staying a few days, who cares, but since I was there for almost 2 weeks, to save money I bought alot of groceries and it would of been nice to have (as i had in the westin).

First the positive: Front desk and concierge service is top notch. Rooms are spacious and clean. The location Is great if you are attending an event. Areas that need serious improvement: The service in both the lobby lounge and the mixing longe is absolutely terrible. On a Monday evening we went to the mixing lounge and sat at a table (the bar was full but the seating area only had 8 people seated) and waited for approximately 10 minutes to order. There were 2 waitresses working but seemed to be more interested in talking to each other than serving customers. I finally went to the bar and ordered. In the hour I was seated at a table not 1 of the staff asked if I would like anything else or even approached me. this is unacceptable particularly when you are paying top $$ for cocktails. The lobby bar is not much better. I was also really disappointed in the housekeeping service. I left my room at approx. 1 PM and saw that housekeeping was servicing the adjacent room. I returned to my room at 5PM and the room had not been cleaned. I spoke with the front desk and they acted like it was no big deal and they would have someone service it. I'm sorry but at $300+ a night it was a big deal to me. The gym is great but he again the staff really need to work on their customer service skills. Too long of a story to bother with... For $300+ a night there should be free internet service for all guests in their room.

The bathroom was lacking enough towels, only had a shower and the shower floor was dirty. Having stayed at the hotel last year we were amazed how worn it seemed- from the service, the rooms, to the presentation of flowers in the lobby.

Even though I was travelling on business, had a confirmed (and paid for) room, I was unable to check in without a credit card. After much dancing I got it arranged but corporate has no flexibility and no mercy - all for the sake of 'possible incidental charges' (there were none, I used none of the additional services, thanks Marriott!). The room, on entry seemed clean enough but on close inspection I found long black hairs in the bathroom sink (I have photos) and curly brown (pubic??) hairs on the shower soap dish. YUCK. Housekeeping eventually (1 hour+) showed up to reclean the bathroom, no apology from the non-english-speaking staff. While I waited I tried to get a snack and a drink. Drinks you can get - that's the ONLY vending there is in the entire building. $1.25 bottle of Coke in hand I checked the room service menu - $14.95 was the cheapest item, club sandwich. Nearly $15 for a SANDWICH? Unless it's delivered by a naked dancing girl that's too much. No, dancing girls not available. Attempted to have pizza delivered - only Pizza Hut apparently pays the kickback and is allowed to deliver there. $15 got a large pepperoni delivered (and was quite good). Tried to call home - cordless phone handset dead, despite 'charge' light. Corded phone would not reach desk area - also had a ring loud enough to startle me and no obvious control to turn down. Cheap and flimsy set to boot. Cinema-size television had extremely weak and very directional remote (cheap) that took several seconds per channel change (television signal obviously delivered via house computer network) and dropped out \/ broke up \/ went dark a LOT. Nice robe in closet for use in spa - size far too small for average guy like me, unless I wanted to flash the other guests, so no spa for you. I decided to try and get some work done - wireless NOT free (don't buy the dodge about 'free wireless in the lobby' - you get one hour and your machine is locked out by MAC address, contrary to staff's hopeful fibs, besides I paid for a ROOM to work in). Not willing to cough up $15 a night (!) for likely awful service I resorted to local Starbucks for my email and web support. After the event I worked, our team gathered for a drink in the bar - their 'best' single-malt scotch? Glenlivet. Waiter had no idea what any of the other truly good malts were - and took 15 mins to deliver one drink with the lounge virtually empty. Motivation obviously pretty low despite the tony ambiance. The lobby was filled with ear-hurtingly-loud boom-boom disco music even in the morning... not sure what that says about the place. My guess is the manager was on vacation. Combine that with the must-have-room-card-to-access-elevator (for every single guest - some trips took nearly five minutes to go through the foolishness of card-in\/punch floor) and the 1960s style (ie hideous) furniture with lots of sharp corners (ow) and I felt very unwelcome. The Holiday Inn in Fremont made me feel so much more welcome - and was far less than half the price.","date":"2015-09-05 21:22:20 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":1,"Location":5,"Overall":1,"Rooms":3,"Service":2,"Sleep Quality":2,"Value":1}},{"author":"Deonte Gutkowski","content":"As the heading states, this is absolutely a fabulous facility, but make sure you check your bill constantly throughout your stay if you booked a package deal.

This happened in my case, but fortunately I had a printed copy of the rate rules for the deal that I had booked through the Marriott website, so they were able to make the necessary adjustments without any problem. But, of course, it was annoying to see the charges (rate included breakfast for two) and then have to provide proof of the rate details to get them adjusted. Of all the Marriott's I've stayed in as a Platinum MR member, I've never encountered this before to the extent that the hotel offers so many different packages that the hotel staff is oblivious to the details of many of the offers and asks for proof from the guest. I'm sure they get lots of push back considering the level of clientele staying in this hotel, but in my case since I had printed the reservation details and had a copy, it eliminated an argument.

The manager eventually offered us complimentary breakfast at the restaurant downstairs, but failed to mention (even after we told her we were in a hurry in the morning and the usless, late room service forced us to skip breakfast and be late for work) she failed to tell us that there's a 30-45 minute wait for a table at breakfast. If a hotel can not get even these elementary services right, it says a lot about the management. And none of what it says is good.

I am sitting in an aqua butterfly chair next to a golden rod, retro-mod loveseat. We have a nice view of the mountains but I think the rooms on the freeway side of the building actually offer the best view.Rooms are almost silent from noise and the hotel feels very booked. The JW toiletries are great and the bathroom is large although no tub in our room. Coffeemaker and small fridge without minibar clutter make this a great room. The thing that really impressed me so far is the staff. The check in team was wonderful. Bright smiles. Very eager to make our stay terrific. Here is how I know this is a great hotel. The real sign of a fantastic hotel is shown when things go wrong. Yesterday the valet smashed the rear end of our rental car. We got a call from Rick the manager and he told us what happened and he did absolutely everything to make sure this did not disrupt our trip in any way. He swaped out the car with our rental company and gave us the use of the garage's car service. We were the first accident the garage has had since it opened so they were very apologetic and quick to make things right. Truthfully, it did mess up our day somewhat but everyone's attitude was so accomodating that we were able to get past it. My only criticism is the fee for Internet at $12.95 a day per computer. I wish these chains would wake up to the fact that free internet is essential for all travelers. I don't want to be charged for something that is not a luxury!

Upon entering, we were taken immediately to the Preferred lounge for check in. We would have at least enjoyed seeing the lobby but were taken via golf cart before entering. We were offered a drink and towel and our concierge took us to our room for a tour. His name was Sabastian. Unlike others have mentioned, we used our conceirge and preferred club a great deal. It was like our own personal butler and personal bartender. There was never anyone there. We are beach people and used, walked and relaxed on the beach each day. Very uncrowded. We could not understand why the pools were so crowded. The beach was incredible as advertised. Service was incredible! We tipped a great deal, but really did not feel that things would be better or worse if we did not. A tip was treated with indifference at bars and restaurants. I struggled with this as since this is an all inclusive, I would have thought a tip would be greatly appreciated and would make a difference. there was a ton of people around and the only service complaint was that we had to ask all the time for something, not servers asking us. Overall, the restaurants and food was great. Oceana was our favorite followed by Il Patio and then Bordeaux was just not good. Why would you want to sit in a small, poorly air conditioned restaurant when you can sit outside enjoying the breeze at Oceana. Finally, the overall resort, service, beach, pools, room drinks, activities were all memorable. We would definitely return and do highly recommend.

I must say, some of the reviews were worrysome, but I am glad we went anyways. We had a brief trip 10-2-09 - 10-4-09, and my only issue is that we didn't have more time to enjoy paradise. Bugs - For us, there were not that bad. They gave us bug wipes, and we kept the screen door closed in our room if we were outside. The fogged around daily numerous times, so maybe they got a better handle it by the time we went... this was a non-issue for us. A\/C - Not an issue at all. Our room was cold at times. Here is the deal... you must close your doors to have the A\/C kick in. If you leave the doors open all day, it will get warm. The only places we thought the A\/C was lacking some was at the World Cafe for Breakfast, and the lobby tended to be warm in the daytime, but not in the evenings. The swim out suite is well worth it. We really enjoyed the privacy of having our own area to swim. The concierge at our own building was so friendly and sweet. She truly would have done anything we needed, and asked us all the time if she could help. The resort overall was so well serviced. The food was excellent at Oceana, the lunch sit down at the Steakhouse by the pool and the breakfasts. This is really all we had time to eat. I would say the World Cafe buffet for dinner was not overly impressive... maybe impressive with the amount of food, but not the quality of food. I did not enjoy that as much. The drinks were so plentiful and awesome. Top shelf for sure. Enjoy!!! I would say that overall it was a wonderful way to spend our 10th anniversary. We will definitely go back and for longer. Don't let the other reviews worry you. Also, just as a side note, we used Cancun Transfers as our transfer. They were direct transfers for $82 roundtrip for 2.

It was always a decent cool temperature, but I made sure to always leave the doors and shutters shut with the fan on full blast all week. It was always cool when we got back to our room. We had a swim-out suite which was great, but we only used it 3 of the 6 days we were there. You really didn't even need it, because of the two beautiful pools at the resort, but it was a nice extra! The beach was gorgeous, we always found a nice hut to lay under and they give you free snorkels to use for 2 hours, great for swimming with the awesome angelfish right off the beach. The pools were a little warm which I actually like. I hate getting into a cold pool. They were still very refreshing! And again, we could always find a spot to sit by the pools as well. The chefs walk around sporatically on the beach and around the pool with little snacks which were great! And the waitresses\/waiters walk around to bring you drinks were awesome! The entire staff was SO friendly and welcoming. We were glad we brought $50 worth of singles to tip everyone, since they were excellent! The italian restaurant was our favorite. We went twice! The seaside grill for lunch was great also! My only complaint was the Mexican restuarant.

The front desk staff were very nice and helpful. You will have to get an internet access code every 2 hours, but they had surprisingly good internet access. The rooms were very large compared to european standards and very clean. Our bathroom was also HUGE compared to european standards and we also had a large rain showerhead and a shower door! I was thrilled. Our room had french doors that opened onto a small cobble stone courtyard and a minifridge. They also had the biggest towels that I've ever seen in Italy. The location was wonderful. You just follow the signs to St. Mark's or Rialto and you can walk anywhere. We did get lost one night, but that was part of the fun of it.

It is a small hotel in the San Croce district, deceptively nondescript from the outside, yet once inside, abundant marble, lovely staircases, warm and very lively decor, just minutes from San Marco and the Rialto bridge. We found it easily right off the Vaparetto as others have remarked. You do need to follow the directions as one is easily and quickly lost in Venice's winding and tall alleys, charming later not so much when first arriving tired with suitcases. The front desk staff were consistently patient and very helpful, the staff throughout the hotel were very friendly. Our room was very clean, It had a jetted bath\/shower, and views of rooftops, and the narrow street, at first disappointing, but I grew to enjoy it as you start to notice the varied balconies, shutters, potted plants. Generous breakfast was included with scrambled eggs, bacon and other cold meats, cheeses, greens, tomatoes, canned peaches, yogurts, dry cereals, breads, pastries, and fresh fruit. Many families stayed there as well as couples, the venue appeared to work well for both. Coffee, espresso, cappuccino, tea, cocoa served by the friendly server, as noted in another review, and at no additional fee. Any time you spend on how to read the street signs will not be wasted. I found the maps not that helpful, but looked for landmarks, and by the end of the second day was feeling more comfortable, very comfortable, moving from San Marco\/Rialto to the hotel, a 15-20 min walk. Easy easy easy to get lost, which was never scary, Venice feels so safe, however, one helpful hint is to key to the posted (written on walls, usually in yellow, some added as hand written notes on arches--none consistent, but often enough to be helpful) main directions for the Rialto and San Marco, and then your closest vapporetto. Recommend San Marco visit early in the day, you will find a line by 0830, it opens at 0945, but worth it, and you are waiting in the shade, unlike later when the line is longer, and in the sun. Go right upstairs (before the crowds), it cost about five euros, but the view is stunning both of the cupola mosaics, and then outside, the grand canal and square. Another reason to stay at Ca' Zusto: it is close to a very wonderful restaurant, \"Trattoria Al Ponte Del Megio\" just a two minute easy walk from the hotel, get a table on the canal people watch while enjoying some of the best food Venice has to offer. Other: AIr conditioner worked very well and was adjusted easily. Elevator worked well to the second floor. A separate smaller elevator from second to third, I could not get it to work--but perhaps it was simply too slow and I did not wait long enough. This second one will fit only one person, and if in a wheelchair, would recommend you ck dimensions,feasibility. WiFi is free but only available on the first floor, the lounge (breakfast room) is lovely for this purpose as well as for reading and relaxing. Quite hotel, away from the bustle, but within easy walking distance to main sites.

We were very impressed by almost every element of this hotel - its location, design and luxuriousness. But we were extremely put-off by the non-functioning air-conditioning (and, in particular) the staff's (non-)response to it. The hotel is well located - quite close to the station and along the \"main drag\" between there and St Mark's Square. At least one other reviewer has recommended taking the ferry there along the Grand Canal, but we walked. The distance isn't a problem at all, and it's not hard to find, but there _are_ two bridges (with stairs) to cross on the way, so consider that if you're lugging suitcases. It's a very modern and renovated place (in an old building). It's listed as four stars and looks it. Quite luxurious, but small and a bit fancier than we needed. And not \"luxurious\" to us in the ways that we find most important. For example, the shower was tinier than most, and the fittings (though modern) don't work well in it. Breakfast was so-so. Nice to have proper coffee and fancy little jams. But the croissants and eggs were no better than places half this price. The only real inconvenience though was the AC - it didn't run, and we suspect the staff were lying about why. The room was quite warm (with not much of a breeze from the windows), and the air-conditioning either didn't work or wasn't turned on. Friends who'd just visited Venice warned us that might be the case - something about laws about the date they can start activating it...? But they also warned us the hotel would be liable to lie to us about the problem. That's pretty much exactly what happened. There were lots of excuses and no real action to resolve the issue - both signs (in our minds) that we were being lied to. We were able to live with no AC. But being misled really rubbed me the wrong way.","date":"2015-03-15 17:18:41 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Overall":4,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":3}},{"author":"Eugene Hayes IV","content":"Unfortunately we only stayed in this hotel for one night, we would have loved to stay for longer!

We had water damage is both bathrooms and the bedroom. The tubs were missing large sections of porcelain and there were tiles missing and cracked everywhere. Counters were mildewed and missing tiles. Kitchen was just kind of old and yucky. The air conditioner unit in the bedroom was right above the bed and so loud and clanky we turned it off to sleep. Our deadolt didn't work, bathroom sink didn't drain and no lightbulb in outside doorway. On the plus side, the area was fantastic. We had a beautiful, large balcony with a view of the golf course and the ocean. It was amazing to sit out and view the scenery. We loved the cabana and beach area.

Short walking distance to the Sheraton and Black Rock. Not that far of a walk to Whaler's Village either. We jogged next to the cart path for some exercise over to the village. Parking garage is in the middle, we were in unit I-201, right next to the garage with a partial golf course view, yet it was booked as a 1 bedroom garden view. The unit is huge for what you pay, 2 beds (we only used one), and a big living room area, plus the patio. Only cons I have is there is no work out facility. If you want to work out, you'll have to pay to use a facility. We jogged along the golf course (as many others do), did some pushups, and swam laps in the pool located on top of the garage instead. We also stayed 2 nights at the Kapalua Villas as a splurge and liked Eldorado better. The Villas were fancy smancy, but for the money, we thought the extra space and fancy stuff wasn't necessary. The location of Eldorado makes it the winner. A clean (firm) bed and shower area is what you're looking for in these places. This one had some mildew on the shower head, so do the Villas, but I can over look that and did mention it to the staff and my followup survey. Both beds were clean and firm here. Black Rock is the best snorkel location, and this hotel is right there. Don't worry about the views. Garden view is fine, and your view will be of a golf course no matter what you pick, even if it's a garden view. Some units do see the ocean, but you're gong to see that in person any way. So if you're on a budget and don't care about the view, the garden view is going to work and you'll be surprised.","date":"2015-11-14 16:37:46 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":"Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur","url":"http:\/\/hotel-monclar.com\/en","vacancy":true}

This condo complex was in a great location and an excellent value. The remainder of our stay was at the Grand Wailea so we were not looking for an ultra luxury location while on Kaanapali. This was our first time to stay at a condo complex and were happy with our decision. The location was easily found by our GPS located in the heart of the Kaanapali Resort area, right near the beach. (There is a section of the golf course between the hotel and beach \/ cabana) The condo is adjacent to Black Rock and the Sheraton. Self parking is $7, which some people were not happy with but I was pleased that the complex does not have a resort fee, which seems to run rampant in Hawaii. We arrived very late due to flight delays and were greeted by the night security guard Randy was very welcoming and took us to our condo and even assisted with our heavy luggage. (Dive gear). There is a central parking garage that always had plenty of space. The condo we were in for the first night was well appointed but unfortunately the curtains were sheer and did not block out any light. (they should consider making this a standard requirement of all the units) If we wanted to rise early every day it would not have been a problem, but since we were on vacation we wanted to be able to sleep in a bit. We went down to the front desk and she kindly gave us the option of a few more units to check out. We selected J120 which was a direct view of the ocean over the golf course. Very well appointed and comfortable. They even took care of transferring out luggage while we were out. Check in was quick and easy and our luggage arrived in our room promptly. The front desk person even gave us a bottle of wine for our inconvenience. I think that this was great customer service. The units are not ultra plush, maybe a bit dated but spotlessly clean. The complex has at least two pools, nothing spectacular, but nice enough for a quick lounge when you do not want to head to the beach. The beach and private cabana as well as Black Rock (great snorkeling) are about a 7 minute walk from the complex and is a really nice perk. I think that the beach is nicer than that of the Sheraton. The cabana has a nice deck with loungers, towels, seat backs for the beach. Though there are not umbrellas available at the beach, there are many nice trees along the dune line if you are looking for shade. The cabana also has a full stove, refrigerator, and sink area. This is a great touch that allows you to bring your drinks, snacks, lunch, whatever while hanging out at the beach. (The cabana was being remodeled and should be complete by now) Though this condo complex lacks the Disney-esque pools of some of the mega resort hotels, we would come back here in a heart beat. It was very centrally located in the Kaanapali area. You could walk to the shops at Whalers village in about a 12 minute casual stroll and easy to find. (Though if you come back at night it can be hard to find the walkways across the golf course......make sure to pay attention when heading out for the night.) The complex has a small lobby with an activity booking agent and a convenience store. There is a nice casual service restaurant in a shopping center right across the street. The rooms had nicely appointed full kitchens, acceptable bathrooms, washer, dryer, King or Queen bed, Couch, dining table, and balcony with chairs. It seems most of the units had 27\" CRT TV's....I am sure owners will gradually upgrade the TV's. The units have free internet, though it is hard wired and not wifi. (If we were staying for a full week we might consider bringing a cheap wireless router) Housekeeping provided refresh service each day and was very prompt to come to our unit the day that we called for service when we had not yet seen them. All of the staff we ran across during out stay was friendly and willing to help when asked for assistance. We stayed at the Sheraton next door last year and for about twice the price I think we would just come back to the El Dorado....we would rather spend the money on activities and found that the location of the El Dorado is excellent. Though the grounds at the Sheraton were more stellar we felt that the rooms at the El Dorado were just as nicely appointed and it was nice to have the kitchen and laundry facilities. We would definitely stay here again.","date":"2013-03-19 18:39:45 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":"Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur","url":"http:\/\/www.hotel-boquier.com\/","vacancy":true}

This is the place to go to relax. The complex is quiet and low key. The pools may be basic but how often can you go to a place and get a whole pool to yourself. The units are spacious and airy, yes they do vary in quality so do your research. The only area of improvement could have been a really thorough cleaning of our unit half way through our stay. As we were there 17 days the bathroom mirrors and sinks could have done with a really thorough clean, same with the kitchen. Having said that I could have asked and I am confident it would have been done, the housekeeping did a great job of keeping us well supplied with towels and amenities. We recommend using the farmers markets for fresh produce and the 'Fish Market' north of the Eldorado in a strip mall just past 'Times\" supermarket. Goofy Foot surf school in Lahainia did a great job getting this family surfing for the first time and we would do it again. The snorkeling at Black Rock closest to the cabana (not the Sheraton side) is good and not crowded, we often saw turtles.

As has been pointed out before, there is variability among the units, so some may be better or worse than ours. We reserved a studio via Orbitz which was a good size, approx. 700 sf. Room was clean, furniture and appliances were in decent shape (not new, but not old either). Dishes and utensils were provided and were decent. As for the location, I find the \"15 minute walk to the beach\" claims to be a bit exaggerated. It's more like a 5-minute walk to the beach. It's not any different than walks to the beach from your room at one of the mega-resort type hotels (the ones with lots of buildings, long hallways, waits for elevators, and strategic paths meandering past shops and concessions). The golf course is between the rooms and the ocean, so the walk is not in a straight line, which may make it feel longer, but it is literally 5 minutes max. The beach was nice and pretty open. Great for sitting or laying out, though there is much better snorkeling next door at the Sheraton (which is signed as a public beach). Nobody said anything to us when we brought our Outrigger towels through the Sheraton grounds to the beach to snorkel. It's probably about a 10-minute walk from your Eldorado room to the Sheraton beach. What was annoying was that the Eldorado has a number of nickel-and-dime fees. Fees for making toll-free calls, fees for in-room coffee (first one per stay is free, additional is extra), charges for laundry detergent (again, first bottle per stay is free, additional is extra). There was even a charge to use the safe, and if you declined it, they asked you to sign a release form at checkin. This doesn't exactly give the visitor a warm-and-fuzzy on arrival. If it were up to me, I'd rather they comp the coffee and safe, and charge for detergent. That would bring them in line with normal hotel standards. The Internet was free, though, which was nice (and fast). It is with a cable, though, not wifi. There's a Safeway and Longs in town, just a few miles down the street to pick up anything you need, along with several dining options.

It was 3 adults- and we booked a 1 bedroom garden view condo- well, as I read on this site before we went, all the condos are individually owned, and therefore are all a little different. The first one they put us in was pretty bad, the decor was tired and dirty, but the biggest surpise was that while they called it a \"1 bedroom condo\" - it was really more of large room with a partial length wall between the beds and living room area, but no real separation or privacy of the sleeping and living\/cooking area. I consider that a studio, and I did see several of these condos. Not what I had in mind at all when booking a \"1 bedroom condo\" for 1 couple and one single adult traveler!! After looking at 4 available rooms, we ended up in a great 1 bedroom partial ocean view condo in with a fully separate bedroom with 2 queen beds, a fold out couch in the living room, and 2 full bathrooms which was a real bonus. Kitchen was small but clean and up to date, and this room was just behind the lobby area so great for parking up front. We were in K204, great ocean view, nice big balcony- and we also saw and liked K104 which had the same layout. This hotel has a great beach which was never crowded, is a 5 min walk to the shops and restaurants in Whalers Village. Main pool was also quiet and had nice BBQ's there as well. If you are shopping for food, I thought the \"STAR MARKET\" just up the road towards Kapalua about 5 min was much better quality and stocked than the Safeway down the road to Lahaina. We got the best fresh local mahi mahi there and that on the BBQ as you watch the sunset from your balcony is pretty great! We ate out at SANSEI in Kapalua for sushi and it was quite good. This is a great condo style set up for familys or couples, and its so nice to be away from the crowds at all the hotels and condos along the beach by whalers village which gets pretty packed, and that is not my idea of relaxing! One last thing, if you are heading over soon, do find a whale watching trip, we did and it was a great experience! I will go back to this hotel for sure!","date":"2012-01-31 08:22:19 +0300","ratings":{"Overall":4}},{"author":"Stephan Muller","content":"My husband and I stayed at the Outrigger Maui Eldorado 6\/18-6\/21.

The main pool above the parking garage was just a cement pond with water with absolutely no Hawaiian charms at all. In a previous post I agree with the person who said the bathrooms were dark and old. We stayed in G building. On the 3rd night there I heard rumbling in our kitchen. Somebody had eaten thru a plastic bag of food. Well when we mentioned that there was a 3rd party in our room and by the bite marks it was very large they said they couldn't move us for a day and not even a sense of \"we are sorry.\" When they did get us a new room they wouldn't even help us move to K building which wasn't close. I even got some snide comments from the staff \"Oh you are the one with the rodent\" and then a chuckle. The manager admitted to me that they knew of a problem in Building G that is why they had an exterminator there the day I found our roommate. They offered to move us to building H but I refused considering it was fumigate the first 2 days of our stay.

But the best hotel for us was the Best Western Premier Regency Suites, and that's high praise since we really enjoyed the other hotels we stayed at. We stayed here for 4 nights. The location is fabulous - it's on Akbiyik Caddesi, which is a street full of cafes, lovely restaurants offering street-side tables in summer, and boutique hotels. It's a five minute walk to Aya Sofya and the Blue Mosque, seven minutes to the Topkapi Saray, and just round the corner from the Arasta Bazar, which is a smaller, less frenzied, and less confusing version of the Grand Bazar, and no pressure from any of the shopkeepers. The waterfront is five minutes away by cab, and Taksim about 20 minutes away. The hotel is small - 16 rooms - but has all the conveniences you would expect, like an elevator, ground floor restaurant serving meals all day long, and even its own hammam and spa! The rooms are great - we had three rooms (401, 403 and 404) on the fourth floor - and are huge, particularly by Istanbul standards. The fittings and furnishings are of very high quality - super comfortable beds, sofas and sitting area, two desks, LCD TV mounted on the wall, room safe, minibar, etc. Perfect to come home to after a long day's sightseeing! Free wi-fi was a bonus, also there is a laptop guests can use, plus a printer downstairs. There's a beautiful rooftop on the fifth floor with views of the Marmara Sea on one side and the Blue Mosque on the other. By the way, some other reviewers had commented on the noise from the call to prayer. Our rooms faced the street, and we had no noise issues at all - the windows are double glazed, and the most we heard was a light murmur one night. Considering it's such a lively street, it was amazingly quiet. The hotel staff was so kind and caring - any requests we had were attended to promptly. The girl at the front desk even told us not to exchange money at the hotel as we could get a better rate outside! Whenever we took a taxi, they would come outside and give the address to the driver in Turkish, and one time when we were taking a cab back to the hotel and the driver was trying to overcharge us when we reached, she actually came outside and yelled at him, and voila! that was the end of his overcharging attempts! Breakfast every day was very good - huge selection of fruits, yogurt, cheeses and eggs cooked to order. Overall, we felt it was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at, and can highly recommend it. We are planning to return to Turkey next year, and will stay here again for sure. For large, well appointed rooms, personalized service and great location, you can't do any better!","date":"2013-12-25 20:44:26 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Miss Cary Koelpin","content":"This is a great hotel for a visit to Istanbul!

I booked what was described as Suite Executive Room and expected what I would normally get from a suite: a separate bedroom and other living area. I wanted a larger room because I was staying 8 days. I got s single room - clearly not a suite - at what was really an outrageous price. This really is misleading advertising and not acceptable. The street where the hotel is located has many other hotels and hostels as well as bars and restaurants. It is fairly downmarket with any walk down the street resulting in being accosted by touts for each. The hotel has a basic restaurant serving uninspiring food. The breakfast buffet is limited and poor. There is a very small range of breakfast cereals and fruit and some poor cold meat products that are really only suitable for feeding to the many cats in the area. There is a top floor open-air balcony but, unlike other hotels, this has no awnings or canopies and so is quite unusable in the hot afternoons. There is a separate smaller balcony area off the fourth floor but this is unfinished. There was building work and associated noise that went on until around 8:00 pm some days but this was not mentioned anywhere on the hotelâ€™s Web site. And on a final note; rooms were typically not made-up until after 4;00 pm. When we arrived back one day after 4:00 pm we were told our room was not cleaned and were offered a drink while we waited. These drinks appeared on our bill at check-out. I have to say that my experience with this hotel is so completely at odds with that of others that I feel something is fundamentally wrong. I selected the hotel based on the Tripadvisor reviews and, based on this experience, have a significantly reduced trust in reviews on this site. The very poor value for money and overall experience invalidates any minor saving graces such as cleanliness.","date":"2013-04-12 20:40:47 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":2,"Overall":1,"Rooms":1,"Service":1,"Value":1}}],"scope":"travel","state":"Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur","url":null,"vacancy":true}

No attempt to help us and even after checking in ... no attempt to bring our bags up to our room (the front desk didn't even ask if we had bags and if we needed help). It's an oversight worth noting (even though I am very capable of handling my own bag) because you would not expect this and never experienced it prior. The room was laid out perfectly and plenty of space. Another minor thing that completely stood out was the half empty bottle of water just sitting on the table. Big oversight for a first rate hotel (and a bit gross since it leads you to question how thorough they clean). The room did appear clean though and the bed was comfortable. Ordered room service and it came up promptly and hit the spot. We ordered extra towels and said we would be leaving the room and to leave them on the bed. No one delivered them. We called again and eventually got them upon our return. The small \"misses\" are noted because of the hotel wanting to be a 5 star facility and my prior experience being so positive.

We ate shotly after the breakfast room opened (7:00 am) and found everything satisfactory. The breakfast was as advertised. There was only on small elevator. We did not experience any long waits. We were on the 3rd floor and often walked down the stairs. The location is great. There are many restaurants nearby. Times Square is less than a block away. You can walk to many attractions such as Grand Central Station, Rockefeller Center, many theaters, Times Square and the bus tours (hop on\/ hop off). This is a great place to stay. We would stay here again.","date":"2012-07-21 16:45:44 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4,"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Value":5}},{"author":"Dr. Alford Zboncak","content":"Just came back from a long week-end in NYC. I agree with everybody. Almost everything was perfect about this hotel (location, cleanliness, friendly staff, small but workable room, decent breakfast, storage room). We got there at lunch time and our room was ready. Perfect! The only, but very important, problem is that I could hardly sleep in our room. The cause: the rooms are not soundproofed at all. We could hear the TV and the children speak in the room next to ours and everything that was going on in the hallway (a family was sharing multiple rooms and was constantly going from one room to the others, screaming, laughing and slamming doors; it was awfulâ€¦). In addition, itâ€™s New York City; people were coming in and out at all hours, slamming doors and screaming in the small hallway. I had problems falling asleep because of all the noise and was constantly waken up afterwards. In the middle of the night, after 3 or 4, I was finally able to sleep. If you are like me a light sleeper, you better select another hotel. Since we are more experienced with the subway system now, next time we plan to stay away from Times Square. For about the same price, we will get a much better hotel. We may even be ready to pay a bit more to get a good night sleep.","date":"2015-11-25 09:06:13 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Overall":3,"Rooms":2,"Service":4,"Value":2}},{"author":"Angel Paucek","content":"While not the swankiest hotel in the midtown area the Comfort Inn Midtown was reasonably priced (for NYC), with reasonably sized rooms (for NYC ) with friendly staff.

The location is amazing, the cottages are nicely furnished and the sunsets from the pier are spectacular. A few negatives; we were given cottage 22 which appears to be the â€œruntâ€� of the cottages. It didnâ€™t have a futon as the other cottages have but it did have two twin size roll out beds. We had our own patio but it was so small that it only contained one lounge chair and a small round table with two (not four) patio chairs and no umbrella. The kitchen was so small that we couldnâ€™t reach the microwave unless we moved the dining chairs away from the table. Another issue was that none of the outlets in the kitchen worked except the one the toaster and coffee pot were already plugged into. From what I could see of the other cottages, ours appeared quite a bit smaller. We were disappointed that we didnâ€™t have a French door as the other cottages did and we had to park a good distance from our front door and not in front of the cottage as other guests could. The parking was a nightmare too. You are only allowed one assigned parking spot per cottage and you get locked in by all the other cars lined up bumper to bumper. The front desk clerk was grumpy about us driving through the gate before we got a key but no one was outside to tell us not to. She was less than friendly at check in. Youâ€™d think the front desk staff would be a little nicer and more professional for the amount of money you pay to stay there. The bathroom was fine and the shower had great water pressure. We brought lots of food with us and even made a big dinner one night. The kitchen did have all the basic necessities (pots, pans, dishes & utensils). You can also get a barbeque grill from the front desk (you provide the charcoal). All in all, it was a fabulous stay. I will definitely return but wonâ€™t stay in Cottage 22 again. I donâ€™t think it warrants the same rate as the other larger 1 bedroom units. There are also tons of shops and restaurants very close. I recommend visiting Pangaea for a cool shopping experience but make sure you have enough time to see everything in this large and very diverse store. Also, try Bustamanteâ€™s on Garnet Ave. We had a fantastic breakfast\/lunch. Good selection on the menu; Mexican cuisine, plus omelets, pancakes, Belgium waffles, you name it. All very good food made from scratch. Good sized servings and each meal came with a fruit cup to start. Also, Edgar is the best waiter\/host you can ask for. He went out of his way to make sure we had a great time and everyone at the table was happy. Be careful not to park on Garnet Street overnight though. I got a $40 ticket for being there between 3am â€“ 6am Tuesday morning when the street sweeper came around.","date":"2012-02-15 05:01:06 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":2,"Value":2}},{"author":"Isaias Jaskolski","content":"My mother-in-law used to stay at this property many years ago.

Your first clue is the lack of signage. The Clift is far too trendy to identify its location by anything so common as a nameplate visible from the street.The valet parking staff is friendly, though, assuming you can find a place for your car on the crowded curb in front of the hotel. Plan on a hefty $40 per night for valet parking.Once inside, the clever theatricality of the lobby, dining room and bar make the efforts to arrive seem worthwhile. Check-in is efficient, if not exactly friendly or welcoming.A warning, though. If you get a room with a pass-through door to the room adjacent, immediately return to the front desk and ask for or pay for a room with solid walls. I did not and my neighbors stayed up all night long playing music and entertaining guests. Despite a call from the manager at 12:30 PM and a call from myself at 3 AM, the noise continued unabated till 4:30 AM, leaving me no recourse but to spend a very early morning in the lobby. Why the lobby? Well, the night staff informed me that while they were sorry, they could not give me another room until the morning manager arrived. Three hours later he did arrive and did give me another room. According to the bell staff, there were ample empty rooms. Apparently due to my group rate, the night staff wasn't authorized to give me another room. In effect, their rules were far more important than my comfort or inconvience. So...no sleep at all at this 4-star hotel the first night.The next night of my four-night stay, a friend and I decided to investigate the bar. The hostess condescended to find us a table and with a great deal of attitude announced that we might have one in a few minutes - depending on how long we were staying!We decided we weren't nearly important enough to enjoy the gloomy darkness and thumpa-wumpa music of the bar at the Clift, so we crossed the street and discovered the delightful Cafe Grand at the equally delightful Hotel Monaco. Evidently Kimpton hotels regard guests as valued friends and Schrager properties - like the ever-so-precious Clift - do not. Unless you share the attitude, of course, and enjoy trading superior glances with the staff.I'll give the Clift ample stars for design and poseur-power.

Trying to save on accommodations, this hotel was the least expensive while still being within SF proper. The adage Penny wise, Pound foolish could be the hallmark for this establishment. The room was barely wider than both my arms spread apart. The bed took up almost all floorspace. The bathroom was only slight smaller than the room itself. Fortunately, I didn't unpack my things upon checking in (I left everything in my bag, in the closet). At around 3 in the morning, I felt something against my skin. When I turned on the light, I could see something moving on the sheet. Instinctively I smacked it, and the result was a bright red stain on the sheet. Immediately I threw the covers off, only to find 3 to 4 more of these bugs scampering away. When I called the Manager and showed him the blood stain on my sheet, I asked him did he know that there were BED BUGS in the room?!?!!! His response: we've had them before (WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!!!). After showering and scrubbing off the top layers of my skin, I ended up going to the downtown Marriott. Yes, its cost was 4Xs the price of the Halcyon, but at least the room was clean, spacious, and I didn't have to worry about being bitten in the middle of the night! Believe me, it's worth paying more rather than being infested. If you do decide to stay here, best to keep your clothes packed (and wrapped in plastic) so you don't bring anything back home with you. Like I said before, I was fortunate to have not unpacked. I made sure though that the clothes I was wearing were BOILED before I went to the Marriott.","date":"2012-07-20 13:20:12 +0300","ratings":{"Business service":-1,"Check in \/ front desk":-1,"Cleanliness":-1,"Location":-1,"Overall":1,"Rooms":-1,"Service":-1,"Value":-1}},{"author":"Asha Hudson","content":"big value for money I have to disagree with earlier reviewers and let you know my expirience. I got to know this hotel through the Lonely Planet Guide and booked by e-mail a room in advance for 3 weeks. No problems, booking was confirmed immediately and the room was kept for me on date of arrival. I even received the entrance-code. On the money-aspect, I got a room for only $ 300 a week, less than moderate, given the advice in most travelguides that for less than $ 100 a day almost nothing of any standard is available. But then the place self, on Jonesstreet it is very central located and easy to reach by foot from Marketstreet or Union Square and surroundings, even from Fishermans Wharf with an astounding view of the bay on one of the highest points, especially at night. The room was cosy but comfortable. It had a private bath and toilet, was cleaned up regulary and fresh towels were supplied. On day of arrival there was even neatly placed a tray with shampoo, a sewing kit and wethaircap. Later on a small soapbar was given. Being an European I asked for a electricityplug for switch from Dutch to American use and they immediatily offered to buy one by my self but get a discount from the hotelroomtarif. What a service! In the room were further on a refridgerator, microwave, TV-set, telephone (local calls are free!), alarmclock, even cups and saucers, coffee (!) and sugar, also a coffeemaker, forks and knives. Where do you get this elsewhere for a comparible price? Nowhere I guess. I had the time of my life staying in SF for 3 weeks and at the end of the day returning to a safe and proper place.

Read a lot of reviews first and club noise and value were the two that concerned me. So first the pros. Steve Wynn has surely built one of the most glamorous hotel resorts anywhere. Just high end luxury abounds around every corner. Like most of the new mega hotel\/resorts, this place is a sprawling Utopia with lavish decor, basically a mega mall with hotel, swimming, night clubs, fancy restaurants, and casinos. Encore (and Wynn) is basically a high end very upscale resort fit for the well off One percenters if you will. Its a white collar wonderland but if you happen to be blue collar, you better plan ahead because there are better value options. The staff was absolutely gracious, accomodating. I was concerned about the staff based on other reviews but quite honestly, they could not have been better, however when the safe wouldnt open it took 1 hour for security to help and that is just unacceptable. Upon arrival, I requested a high floor away from the strip as sleep is important to me\/us. The request resulted in a $20 per night \"upgrade\" to a 61st floor panoramic view of north and west Vegas which was decent. Unless there is an ocean, the view matters little to me. How long you gonna stand there and look? The rooms are very very nice, huge bathroom. The bed was absolutely without a doubt the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The bathroom was not sufficiently clean when we went in, as I was looking to substantiate reports of mediocre housekeeping. In particular, they sink counter had splash residue from previous guests that a simple wipe down could have taken care of. Not enough for a complaint to the staff though. The bell boy who brought our bags up took time to explain the technology in the room which was quite helpful and garnered him a worthy tip. Housekeeping the remainder of the trip was timely and there were no issues. DO NOT tough the in room bar or snacks, unless your rich. You can get water and snacks downstairs at the shop by the elevators at still high but more affordable prices. This is NOT a place to take your children, and I would suggest this is an adult resort. So the rooms are nice, the staff was great as expected for a five star. The cons: Value. Be it a bottle of beer, water, coffee, a snack or meal, you are going to pay a premium. For a blue collar guy, this will hurt, but it is common on the strip to pay $7.00 for a bottle of beer. Double that for the clubs you pay to get into. Same for food. Its $50 foir the lunch\/breakfast buffets, and over $80 for dinner that is basically that same with slight variation. THere are better values on the strip and the food was medicre for a pricey buffet. The SOciety Restaurant we had breakfast and still pricey for the quality. Service is good, but value no so much. Gaming. I am an avid blackjack player. I did not play one hand at Encore or Wynn and I probably never will. I searched for a mid limit table where dealer stands on soft 17s. Found one at $50 and one at $100. The rest were all dealer hits on soft 17s and that is a big house advantage. So I gambled at more player friendly places. Sad how some expensive Casinos are totally taking advantage of the small bettors. Should be the same for all. So Encore to me is all about the luxury resort itself, something to see, but for value and gaming there are better value options. I will never stay again because I refuse to pay high end prices for mediocre food and I refuse to play a game where house edge is double vs other places. THe one other negative which might be positive for some is location. Its far north end of strip so plan on walking or paying a lot of cab fares to see the rest of the strip. If you are wealthy this place was made for you and thats probably what Mr Wynn intended anyways when he spend 4 billion $ to create it so more power to him and those that can afford it.","date":"2013-05-23 08:36:24 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":3,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":3}},{"author":"Kale Weissnat DDS","content":"This is a beautiful hotel with alot of high end amenities. My husband and I had a 10 night stay in Las Vegas. We stayed in 3 different hotels during our stay. First 2 nights we stayed at the MGM Grand (have stayed here over 5 times). Next 3 nights were at the New York New York Hotel (have stayed here over 5 times). Our last 5 nights were at the Encore (have stayed here 3 times). The encore has far nicer rooms than the MGM and New York New York. The Encore is at the complete opposite end of the strip from the first two hotels. We enjoy changing hotels and getting a different vibe from the different hotels. MGM has fairly large rooms but the views are always terrible. The casino is HUGE. The foodcourt is lively and very busy. There is a nice stroll to shopping facilities as well as many restaurants. When we checked out all we had to do was walk across the bridge to get to New York New York. New York has a younger crowd vibe (we are in our early 50's). The rooms are a little smaller than MGM however compared with other hotels in the U.S.A they would be classified as high end. We have always had good views from our stays at New York. Given a choice I would stay at the New York hotel over the MGM hotel. Casino is smaller and during our Friday Saturday night stay very lively. There is a dual ling piano bar that is very popular and fun. There is also a Irish Pub that is a great place to get a Guinness. Food is reasonably priced at the food court and very good. The deli sandwiches, fish and chips and deserts were particular favorites. We planned our trip that we would not walk any farther than halfway down the strip (we used the Flamingo as our stopping point. When we checked out of New York New York we decided to walk to the Encore (we have made this walk many times on previous holidays so we did know how long it was). Our intention originally was to take a cab but we were energized that day and had no problem pulling our 1 suitcase and carrying our 1 back pack. If you do decide to do this there are many places to stop and sit for a minute if your feet get tired. The vibe at the Encore is immediately so different from the first two hotels. Much more staff attends to you and they really do make checking in and checking out a delight. Much more efficient than the first two hotels. The grandeur of the encore immediately takes you aback. Beautiful, beautiful red decor. Rooms have floor to ceiling windows so views are great. We were on the 28th floor and were offered a upgrade to a higher floor for 20.00 more. We declined the offer and we were very satisfied with the view that came with our room. We ate at the Wynn buffet twice during our stay and upgraded the meal to 10.00 each for all you can drink champagne (there are some other drinks available at that price but we chose the champagne). Someone in another review stated that some of the food was not fresh. I would have to disagree with that statement. Everything was great and all was fresh. We intended to try some of the other restaurants at the Encore but it did not work out for us with the shows we were going to see. In this order my favorites are Encore - Classy New York - Fun MGM - Has everything I would stay at any of these properties again. Have fun in Vegas!!!!!!!!!!!!","date":"2012-11-17 03:04:23 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Hipolito Runolfsson Sr.","content":"We've been to Vegas several times and stayed at several places including Belagio. Encore was by far the best so far. The only problem was that the light system would go on everynight at around midnight and wake us up. There was no alarm on or anything and we never figured out why. Other than that, the spa was amazing and had the softest sheets I've ever felt. We had to go purchase them for our home. Also, the smoke smell throughout the casinos is always terrible, but not as bad for some reason at Encore as it was in Belagio or some of the others. We went golfing at the Wynn course and had Ray Romano tee off right before us and David Spade was about an hour behind us. We saw Garth Brooks who put on a great show. We also saw Le Reve by Cirque du soleil which was nice.

It is decadent from the minute you walk in, highly ornate and spectacular decor throughout the hotel, gaming areas and plush rooms that will make one feel like royalty. The service they provide is to die for, the attention to detail is intricate, and all the restaurants that I tried were spot-on. Encore is bustling with the best night clubs (XS was my favorite!) and high-end shopping. Particularly loved the connectivity to Wynn Hotel which has more gaming,dining and night clubs. The location on the strip is also great, accessible and close to the mall for those who need a break from the casinos.

We requested a strip view room on check-in and got a room on the 30th floor (I think). Due to the curve of the building our room was the closest to the strip in the Resort side of the floor and we had a fantastic view down the strip including Treasure Island, Mirage and Caesars. We could watch the Mirage volcano from our room. The room was large with a comfortable couch and lovely bed. The bathroom was enormous. The pool was pretty quiet but had excellent service with waitresses constantly coming around with complimentary fruit bowls and taking drinks orders. Service was excellent and all members of staff that we dealt with, from receptionists to dealers to cleaners were all very friendly. We got turn-down service one night even though we didnt request it and then someone else tried to do it on the same night!! The room was cleaned everyday and all common areas of the hotel were very clean at all times. The casino is fairly small and quiet compared to some other resorts but the dealers were excellent. The casino is also pretty light which is a nice change from some of the dark ones elsewhere on the strip. The hotel is located to the north of the strip next door to Wynn across from Fashion Show Mall and close to Venetian\/Palazzo, Treasure Island and Mirage. We had no issues with the location and could comfortably walk anywhere that we wanted to go on the strip. Although we could hear the bass from the Beach Club it didnt prevent us from sleeping at all. This hotel is easily the best hotel that I have ever stayed in and would gladly recommend it to anyone visiting Las Vegas.","date":"2013-10-21 03:18:04 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":4,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Eladio Connelly IV","content":"Everything is perfect, what you should expect from Vegas.

Usually stay at the Wynn but the prices for the Encore were much better and I like that the casino is much quieter there. Going to bed the first night at 1 AM I could hear people partying in the next room loudly, eventually they quieted or went out for the night. The sound seemed to come through the windows room to room on the 60-something floor and it was nothing I had experienced at any other Vegas hotel. At 7 AM the room that backed up to my bed (a different room) was blasting electronic dance music that I thought I was at a rave. The people were screaming and dancing and jumping on the beds. I called hotel security who quieted them briefly before they started up again. I called to complain again and was told my the operator that this is Vegas and I should expect noise. Yeah, maybe in the hallway baby, not a crackhead rave party in my room, especially not at that hour! Later that day I went to the front desk and my room was moved. First of all, the Encore is a nice, high-end hotel (for Vegas). I expect both higher-end guests and higher-end treatment. Secondly, I don't understand why I had to be inconvenienced and move when the guests on both sides of my room where clearly inappropriate. For this inconvenience the hotel gave me a $75 credit, they should've comped the room for the night or at the very least given a major upgrade when I moved. The reason I am giving the hotel 4 instead of 3 stars is that all the restaurants serve Vegan food which is delicious and a treat when you can get it without complaint in high-end restaurants. Also, the hotel and the hotel rooms are very nice. However, the management staff has a lot to learn about treating clients.","date":"2015-03-20 10:06:22 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":1,"Value":3}},{"author":"Marley Wuckert","content":"Great hotel with great amenities.

We stayed in a tower suite (got it on tripadvisor - rates for about $325\/night AUD) and it was beautiful, complete with strip and pool view and electronic everything. From the tv to the blinds it is all remote controlled, you almost don't want to leave the room! We did however and found the shopping (although a little pricy, but hey it is a top line Vegas Casino after all), the grounds\/pools and the restaurants were all unbelievable. The only slight downside I will say is that the casino is mainly for big players it seems (high table minimums) and lacks a little atmosphere, but I must say we are not big gamblers and were happy to stay on the slots, where we were always looked after with a constant supply of drinks (much better service than other casinos in Vegas I have experienced). The major bonus of staying in the hotel we found however was VIP entry into all of the Wynns night and day spots, the Sunday pool party is a must and the highlight of our stay.

I was there with a few friends to celebrate us turning 30 this year, I had emailed Encore in advance to see if they would make our special trip more special (usually hotels offer upgrades etc) but they never responded nor did they do anything special.

There were 3 staff on the reception desk, and no queue. The girl was very nice, and when she read 'honeymoon' on the paperwork, she upgraded us to a suite on the 58th floor.  The room was stunning, and the view down the strip at night was amazing from so high up. It wasn't until the morning I could see a huge empty golf course on the left, and numerous swimming pools! It was a huge room, beautifully decorated and even had remote control curtains!  The TV in the bathroom didn't work, but as we didn't spend much time in the room we didn't care.  Once we'd unpacked, we decided to have a brief 'explore' as we were hungry. We found a small shop in the hotel that sold sandwiches and drinks - so bought some stuff. A sandwich, 2 bags of crisps, 2 bottles of juice, a bottle of water and an ice cream mars bar - $38! At that point we decided to avoid the hotel shop and get 'supplies' elsewhere! We went to the pool on a couple of occasions. It was really nice and had plenty of loungers available. They gave you towels, and often handed out bottles of water. There were also water dispensers around the pool too.  With the 115degreesF temperature at the time, I guess they wanted to keep everyone hydrated.  We ate in Switch restaurant in the hotel which was one of the best meals I've ever had. The food was divine and the setting is amazing. It was probably the most expensive meal we ate in Vegas, but it was worth every penny. (approx $240 for 2 mains, 2 deserts and a few drinks).  We also ate at the pizza cafe in the hotel which was lovely and pretty cheap.  The duelling pianos bar was really cool, but you HAD TO purchase at least a drink each before they'd let you in! $30+ for a beer and a cosmo!  We discovered the best way to drink in the hotel was to play slot machines - as you don't have to pay (just a tip to the waitress). That way, the $30+ rounds cost $5 each! Our plane had a huge delay on it, and we ended up staying an extra night (which BA paid for - thanks!). The staff were really helpful when sorting it out, and even gave us our better room at the standard rate.  As we'd originally booked a package we didn't know about the 'resort fee' - but on our extra night we had to pay it. The benefit of paying the 'resort fee' is that you get free wifi.  Although the hotel is on the strip, it's maybe a bit far away from most things. It's a fair walk to some of the other hotels since it's located quite far up the strip. It's good for the Fashion Show Mall - which is a 5 min walk. If I return to Vegas I'd probably try and stay somewhere nearer the middle of the strip so that I have easy access to all the hotels \/ casinos.   On certain days they have a Beach Club - which is essentially a night club during the day. We never attended - but it was a nightmare trying to get a taxi at 6pm as there were hundreds of drunk youngsters trying to get home. We stood in line for about 25mins - which made us late for our restaurant reservation. We also went to get a taxi at 4am to go home... just as the Surrender nightclub had come out. Thankfully the doormen had the sense to let us skip the queue since we had 4 suitcases! Although we were on the 58th floor, we could hear the music from Surrender when in bed. In summary, Encore is an stunning hotel. It's beautiful both inside and out, and the staff are brilliant. It does come at a price though! Would I go back - probably not. I'd rather try somewhere else a bit more central... However I would recommend it for a one off.","date":"2015-12-26 23:27:43 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":3,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":3}},{"author":"Eladio Walker","content":"Encore is a very nice hotel.

I have stayed at many wonderful hotels, but the Encore by Wynn was just wonderful on every level! I loved the \"suite\" feature of all of the Encore rooms and the bathroom was HUGE. Beautiful linens, room spotlessly clean, excellent amenities. I liked the fact that we were on the North end of the strip, and could get away from the noise and the crowds. We like to walk and had no problem navigating the rest of the strip. After visiting almost every hotel on the strip, we definitely made the right choice. Wonderful staff as well - the concierge was great securing reservations and even just making recommendations. We ate at several of the restaurants and thoroughly enjoyed every meal. Pricey, like all of Vegas, but excellent with top notch service. Love the shopping within the Wynn complex as well! Especially the Manolo Blahnik store! Hands down, the best place we've ever stayed and we will be back.

We stayed on the 60th floor with an awesome view of the strip.   Something I realized this trip is that there are no casinos or hotels in Vegas that even compare to the Wynn.   It was so nice to see such a clean resort with fresh flowers placed throughout it daily.  No one else does the little things like that.  Not even the newer Aria has anything to compare.  Now, even as a big fan of the Wynn, here's  a couple of things I disliked... We arrived on Thursday to a partially empty casino, it was awesome!! Not a lot of smoke, not a lot of people and we were actually winning money!! Everyone was happy... This was short lived because as soon as Friday arrived EVERYTHING changed. Like a switch was switched..  I guess the pro's arrived and took over.  The place became super packed, the smokers arrived in herds and I lost all the money I had won, plus some.  I know, I know - it's a casino, duh...but I think the next time I go I'll try to go during the week with the other amateurs.   Oh and another helpful tip,  park on the top floor, level 4 if you get a car rental..  It's a lot cooler with plenty of parking.  Unlike the other $@!#% casinos, the Wynn makes parking and entering the resort a breeze.   Love the koi ponds they have at the entrances to their uber elite villas.  I always love to go there and just hang out for a few minutes, so very refreshing.  Thanks Wynn, <3 you for being the best!","date":"2014-09-07 00:53:22 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Overall":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":"Rhône-Alpes","url":"http:\/\/www.hotelfaucigny-chamonix.com\/","vacancy":false}

The normal rates for the Wynn or Encore are out of our Las Vegas traveling budget so we were thrilled with the offer. Would I stay again, free or not, probably not? I suppose the pros and cons will intermingle here. The casino décor is really, really red and somewhat gaudy. It is very different from the Wynn or the Bellagio that Steve Wynn built. The room is nice with plenty of space for personal belongings but not as big as it appears on the website. The beds and pillows were comfortable. Although there are outlets by the bed they are taken by the rooms “gadgets” so I just unplugged the lamps. Speaking of gadgets, the control for the curtains is on the bedside table, is not illuminated, so when I wanted to open the curtains in the morning for a just bit of light I had to stumble around with the control and subsequently woke my husband. The honor bar had a variety of choices that I personally found to be exorbitant e.g. 5$ for a 12 oz can of soda and 8$ for a tin of Reese's Pieces. The wifi is included in the 20$ a night resort fee and there was a printer\/fax machine in the suite; the fax has a cost to it but I do not know about the printer itself. The bathroom is spacious and the amenities very nice such as shoe polish, cotton balls, q-tips. The shampoo, shower gel etc. was much larger than the standard hotel and is lemon grass fragranced. The towels were very thick and plentiful and there are robes too. There is a ledge that allows plenty of room for personal items without cluttering the counter top. On the down side the bathroom does not have much room to hang anything including a hand towel and the bathtub is short! My husband, who is 6’1 and can stretch out comfortably in our normal size home tub, had to scrunch his knees up in the Encore room tub. I also found it weird that the water controls are on the back not to the side or front of tub. The line at check in wasn’t long and there was plenty of staff but still took longer than it should have in my experience. The staff we encountered were all very courteous and would actually hold\/start a conversation. Housekeeping during our stay was excellent everything was put back in order just as the moment we arrived; although with being in a hotel of this caliber right after we checked in I was shocked to find a hairball behind the bathroom door (which was cleaned up the next day). We did use one of the pools at the Encore and had a good time; it was not the one with the bar or the beach club. This pool was easy to access from the elevators just off the casino floor and was a mix of people. We brought in our own drinks in a non-breakable cup they also had ice water readily available throughout the pool area. There were limited shaded areas. Ok after all this rambling why would I not stay there again. I suppose it is all location and incidental costs for me. I felt very disconnected from the rest of the strip; it is an easy walk to the Venetian but not much else. I like to be more centralized where I have more options for gambling and food choices. Perhaps for many who may stay at this property this is not a huge issue but there was nowhere that I found to “grab a quick (inexpensive) bite” or table games less than a 25$ minimum. I have stayed on the strip in a room just as nice , with a great pool, coffee maker, refrigerator and a nicer view for a lot less money.","date":"2013-03-22 21:28:30 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Vinnie Connelly","content":"The hotel is stunning to look at. Check in was very quick. We arrived after 9pm on a Friday and were offered either the 17th floor strip side or the 37 floor on the quiet side. We chose quiet, the view was high enough that you could avoid looking at the partial construction site and look at the mountains or Wynn golf course. At night we had a view of the city lights, Stratosphere, Circus Circus. Our room looked very much like the website pictures, except that I believe our room was an accessable room. There was not a private toilet room, so having this big giant bathroom was pointless for those of us who like a little privacy. The towels were a bit grungy (looked like someone had mopped up mud with them and it didn't all come out in the wash), hair in the tub, dust on the crooked lamps in the bathroom, hearing neighboring room's noise - is not a five star hotel in my opinion. Details like a second box of kleenex outside of the bathroom, a second set of hooks to hang things in the bathroom (as ours were maybe 3 feet from the floor, and our closet had low shelves, so there was no place to hang anything longer than a shirt) were also missed. The bed was pure comfort. Each morning we went to the adult pool and pressed the button as we left for housekeeping. Our room was always ready when we returned. We ate at several of the casual restaurants for breakfast and lunch. For small meals, the pizza place on the Wynn side was great to grab a slice from (lovely to eat outside by the waterfalls) or the lobby bar at Encore. We tried Stratta before LeReve. The meal was fantastic, but too much food. I must have mentioned when I purchased tickets for LeReve that is was for my husband's birthday; because our server at Stratta brought out a georgeous little dessert cake and candle at the end of our meal. We are not gamblers. We visit Vegas for relaxing, shows, restaurants and shopping. We'd spend a little at the quarter slots before heading to our room each night. The drink service was quick. I enjoyed the wine they served in the casino more than the glass I had at Stratta. We enjoyed our stay at Encore, the casino, pool, restaurants and shops are luxury. I was a bit disappointed with our room; perhaps my expectations were too high, but there were details that they missed. On our next trip it will be a hard decision whether to stay at the Encore or return to the Palazzo (loved the bathroom at Palazzo with the seperate vanity table).","date":"2012-05-25 20:04:50 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Jules Maggio","content":"we stayed from sunday to wednesday.. check in was very efficient and pleasant..apparently we qualified for $100 resort credit which we used for a breakfast buffet one day and a lunch buffet the next day..

You don't need to worry about finding the hot spot, because its at either the Wynn or Encore every night. We stayed at The Encore, but it is connected to the Wynn, and from what I could tell the amenities are the same. It is 5 star service all the way. You feel like a celebrity or royalty when you are there. And you will probably see a few while you are there. I highly recommend spending some extra bucks if you are attending the night clubs or pool party and get table service, or a cabana. It is much more enjoyable this way... and hey your in Vegas. For dining, there are many options and all of the restarants are fabulous. My favorite place, and if you are in the mood for a steak, get a reservation at Botero. Get a few side's to share around the table, as these are not your normal side dishes. Get the Mac n Cheese, and trust me this is no box stuff. The staff at the hotel was beyond expectations. The rooms are large, and immaculate. Beds are very comfortable, and when you go home, you are going to want to redo your bathroom to mimic your stay at Encore. I've never spent so much time in the bathroom. If you are doing some gambling don't be shy with your players card. You can talk to the concierge and get some extras with all of your play.

We got a great rate, and upon arriving at the hotel, the staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. When I happen to mention in passing that it was our honeymoon, they upgraded our room (even though we had pre-paid through travelocity). Throughout our stay they were accomodating of our needs and extremely helpful with suggesting restaurants, local attractions, etc. We enjoyed our guest room and found it very comfortable and cozy. We had a suite that you walked directly into from the driveway, and it had a private patio with a little creek behind it. It was very relaxing and very different from a traditional hotel experience. The location was great too. We rented a car and found it very easy to get around San Diego and its surrounding areas. It would only take between 2-10minutes to get anywhere, even downtown. And, our room had a parking spot right next to the door, so parking was extremely convenient. Although we were spending our honeymoon there, we were also impressed with how family friendly Paradise Point is (yet, we didn't feel over run by kids- definitely a plus for newlyweds just wanting to spend some quality-quiet time together for their honeymoon). We feel as though when we have a family we would definitely go back and stay there. Overall, Paradise Point was a great experience that I would recommend to family, friends, colleagues and anyone else.

Plus side Great location, Easy driving distance from the airport, Sea World, Old Town San Diego (great restaurants in Old Town), parks etc. The resort feels very lush with many pools to choose from, and the fire pits are a nice touch. Staff was helpful with directions and at check-in. (your on your own getting to your room) The Negatives: Stayed in room 158, the beds are the worst I've ever slept on. The beds in the room need to be replaced, they are saggy, and every time you moved the springs creaked like a cheap motel 6 bed. (Wife and I had the worst sleep ever on a bed here) As mentioned from a previous reader, resort is quite large and when we checked in, we got a map and basically had to fend for yourself to find the room. It was kinda funny watching people wander around looking for their room especially at night when its dark at the resort. Not cool. Their high end restaurant (Baleen) is way over priced and average food. Wife ordered the steak and I had the halibut dish. Both were very salty. This is to bad since the location is lovely and the waiter was nice. Their other restaurant (Barefoot) has okay, breakfast food nothing special, their dinner wasn't great. Again nice location. The waiter\/waitresses were average Paying $25.00 per day for parking and $9.95 per day for slow internet is ridiculous. Isn't the rooms expensive enough?? My one major recommendation if you stay in their garden view rooms is request a room that isn't facing the road around the resort. Ask for the rooms that you have to park and walk around the building,they are facing the ponds, grass etc. They are a lot quieter.","date":"2013-06-14 22:51:03 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":4,"Overall":2,"Rooms":3,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":1,"Value":3}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ila-chateau.com\/aulnois\/","vacancy":false}

The hotel staff was exceedingly helpful and friendly (every single one of them). The room (a bayside 1 bedroom bungalow) was clean, roomy, stylish and very comfortable - with a gorgeous view of the bay and bridge. The property is expansive with many beautiful paths and lagoons to enjoy. The public parks that border the resort are equally lovely and offer endless places to just sit and relax and gaze at the bay. For half our stay we were joined by our extended family. All were as pleased as we were with their rooms (basic lanai and not on the bay) and with their experience as whole - including our 2 young grandchildren. It is pricey but no more so than other San Diego resorts. We booked 4 nights for the price of 3 (still available at the time of this review) and felt we got our money's worth (we stayed 8 nights for the price of 6). The restaurant (the least expensive of the two) was actually very well-priced for a resort; although the menu seemed somewhat limited. Reading some of the other reviews, I'm truly mystified.

No hotel staff around to let them know-adults only!! Many places like this are overrated.

They had campfires on the beach in the evening with tiki torches lighting the area. Very nice. However, even with all this good, my biggest complaint is thin walls. I don't want to hear the party next door, and I did, on both sides. Luckily, we got a decent crowd on both sides and they went to bed at decent hours and they were not partiers. I would predict however, some people would encounter these issues. They can fix cosmetic or other easier fixable items, but adding more insulation to their newly decorated rooms will not happen easily. There is a $25 parking fee to park your car, right outside your room and the bar and grill is pricey ($14) for order of nachos. We ate appetizers, two beers and one iced tea and our bill was $80. However the view was gorgeous, so your paying for the ambiance. It's very close to sea world and right next to Mission Bay Park, so location is wonderful. Beds were comfy. Rooms newly decorated and very clean. I would recommend, but warn friends of the thin walls.","date":"2012-07-25 06:56:41 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":3,"Rooms":3,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":3}}],"scope":"travel","state":"Île-de-France","url":"http:\/\/hotel-bleu-france.com","vacancy":false}

Ordered room service while there and it was very nice, well presented and tasty. They also followed it up with a call to check everything was okay which was nice.

From rude staff to registration mix-ups, my experience has taught me to start a new hotel relationship with extreme caution. However, from the moment I began working with Jessica and her team at the Florida Hotel & Conference Center, I could tell this was going to be different. The sales staff was friendly, knew their stuff and very responsive. Barry stepped in beautifully even while Jessica was away so we could keep our planning on schedule. They were very flexible with my rooming and event needs and never made me feel like I was inconveniencing them. I had unconventional room layout needs and they were more than willing to work with me on those. Coordinating 350 people from 22 states into 2 days was not easy, but they make it look that way. The banquets team was also especially helpful, not making us wait more than a few minutes to follow through on room changes. Kudos to Verna for running such a sharp and well run machine! My only regret is that this team canâ€™t follow us when we do events in other states! All hotels can learn much from the open communication, friendliness and commitment to customer satisfaction that the Florida Hotel & Conference Center Team have.

I liked the breakfast area, although it did get a bit noisy when the \"rush\" hit about 8:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning. The room was similarly clean and comfortable. The wireless internet connection (free) was useful. I also liked their simply-put, straight-forward internet privacy policy (\"You have no expectation of privacy...). No beating around the bush there--wish others would spare us the jibberish and just come out and say what is obvious: on an unsecured, free wireless internet network connection, you don't have any privacy! There was just one problem, and I discovered later that a colleague who has stayed here twice experienced both times on this visit. I did not get my wake-up call, which made me late for a meeting. That is unaccetable, especially when I asked the front desk about the reliability of their wake-up calls. My back-up system for awakening (the hotel's very cheap alarm clocks) proved equally inadequate. The alarm did go off, but was so quiet that it couldn't be heard and didn't do the job.

It turned out to be a good choice, for it was a comfortable stay and the staff obviously put a lot of effort into making it a quality establishment. When we left they even had staff doing work in the garden. The room itself was good, with two beds, a fridge and coffee maker. Amazingly, the wifi also worked in the room, which I found to be something of a rarity for places in this price range. The floor sloped slightly downwards, which was a bit odd, but it didn't matter at all. There is plenty of parking, even if the spaces are quite tight. The motel is equipped with a gym, which I didn't use, plus an outdoor pool, which looked quite good but was far too cold when I was there. The business center was very useful, for I was able to print out flight tickets. Breakfast was good (though waffles would enhance it!), but was packed away promptly at 9:30. It was good to fill up in the morning while watching the news before going into New Orleans for the day. That brings me to the location - it's not in an area that you'd want to walk around, but isn't too far from fast food places and is very close to the interstate, so it's easy to get into New Orleans itself. A lot of the motels in New Orleans are in this area.

The room was recently (and quite lavishly) refurbished and quite spacious (even with an additional bed for our 14 year old son). The bathroom was huge. There was free wireless internet access from the room, The hotel seems to be a smaller off shoot from a nearby hotel and so there aren't a lot of staff. But those that there are, were friendly and very helpful. The manager Reza seemed to be everywhere and very willing to help. When my wife enquired about a coffee shop when we first arrived after a long flight - Reza was back with a cappuccino almost immediately. Breakfast was basic but more than adequate. The hotel is centrally located near to the main railway station - but off a quiet street. And the cost was very reasonable compared with other places we stayed in Italy.

The hotel staff were very helpful in unloading and loading baggage from our vehicle. The rooms were very clean, hot water was plentiful and the kitchenette was well stocked with all the essential for food preparation. There is a 24 hour grocery store right next door and the metro is about a 5 minute walk away. Very close to McGill and would be an excellent base for anyone moving a student to that instituation in the city. We stayed in a room with a king bed and pullout queen sofabed. The queen sofabed was suprisingly comfortable as these types of sleeping arrangements can be touch and go depending on the hotel. Also included were 2 plasma TV's and free parking through a little laneway behind the hotel. The hotel is an excellent value when used as a home away from home.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good and they went out of their way to make sure everyone was finished and had all they needed before closing up the breakfast area. The room was clean and comfortable. There was a little wear showing in the bathroom but nothing unacceptable. The pool was warm but only 3 1\/2 feet deep. They had a hot tub and a workout room. The location was good but a little bit hard to find if you didn't have a printed map with directions. With the directions we had no problems finding it. You had to wind through a residential area and appartment complexes. It was right near the Gallaria mall and close to the freeway. One evening my two children and I arrived back at the hotel probably about 11:30pm and we were approached in the parking lot by a nicely dressed man saying he and his wife were stranded back on the highway and his family was in Ohio and they needed money to stay in a neighboring hotel. They were short $16.00 and could I help them out. I gave him $20.00 and hurried into the hotel. Legitimate? who knows, well probably not but I figured 20.00 was worth there being no scene or other problems with my kids there. I didn't really feel unsafe and the parking lot was very well lit. This hotel is directly next to an Embassy Suites and a Motel 6 so there are other hotels in the area.

Mostly from two things - our air conditioner was SOOO loud, it sounded like an airplane engine. We were going to change rooms but figured they would probably all be that loud. Not only was it loud but also rattled - so annoying. But that wasn't the worst part, we got up on our second morning and walked to our car and see some people standing around their car and they asked if our car was ok because their truck's passenger window had been smashed out and items were stolen. Luckily our car was fine but we felt really bad for them. Then the hotel never cleaned up the glass, it was still there when we left this morning! The location of the hotel is not great. It is confusing to find, confusing to get on I-75N from, and there is a sketchy apartment complex right behind it with some creepy\/sketchy people walking through the parking lot at all hours. No wonder you have to use your key card to access the front lobby after 9pm! The only good thing about the place, the price and the room layout. You have a separate living room area and separate bedroom area. Too bad the air conditioning is only in the bedroom area so that made it difficult for the living room to get cool enough. Oh, one last thing, you should bring an eye mask if you want to sleep in, the windows didn't have heavy curtains to keep the room dark. Only sheer curtains, I couldn't believe it. Anyway, I hope this helps you decide if you want to stay here or not. I would personally suggest staying a little more north - like at the Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Select (along 75 in Richardson).","date":"2015-04-08 03:32:07 +0300","ratings":{"Overall":2}},{"author":"Larry Klocko","content":"Hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating, though most of the housekeeping staff does not speak English. Room was clean except for one spot on the bedspread but I never use hotel bedspreads anyway, so it wasn't a big deal for me. Everything else was fresh and clean. Entire hotel is non-smoking which is a major plus for me. Pets are allowed with a deposit but if people actually take their pets there, you'd never know it. There was no smell at all nor did I have any issues with allergies from pet dander. Beds and pillows were VERY comfortable. Rooms and hallways were very quiet. We never heard our neighbors or any outside noise at all. Windows do open but it was too warm for us to take advantage of that. When we checked in the AC had already been turned on for us so the room was nice and cool - perfect after such a long drive. Hot tub and pool area were very clean and no too many people used them. However, the chlorine smell was VERY strong and caused some eye and allergy irritation for some of us - even those who didn't get into the water. We were able to prop open the emergency exit door to the outside and it got a little better. Room has a fairly low ceiling so if they used better ventilation or had a higher glass ceiling, it might not be so bad. Also, there is a lot of echo in that room - more than you'd think - and it's hard to carry on a conversation, even in the hot tub. Continenal breakfast included make-your-own-waffles and the waffle iron was shaped like Texas, which everyone thought was cool. Also had a limited selection of bagels, english muffins, bread for toast. Bananas and apples were the fruit choices. Small boxes of Kelloggs cereals available. Also had sausage biscuits, breakfast burritos and sausage\/pancake corndogs that could be microwaved. No microwave in the rooms but the breakfast room was open 24 hours so you could use that if needed. Several restaurants and fast food places close by. Also not far from both Kroger and Walmart Supercenter. Overall, not a place I'd go if I was looking for a vacation where you relax at the hotel- rooms are fairly small but adequate for sleeping. Double queen room does not have enough room for an added rollaway, for example. But for an on-the-go vacation where all you need is a clean comfy place to sleep, a decent breakfast and that's convenient to everything, this is a great choice.","date":"2014-04-02 02:22:50 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":3}},{"author":"Henry Sporer","content":"We have stayed at this Fairfield Inn six times, the most recently in September, 2006 during a househunting trip.

We checked both sinks and the shower and actually got video footage. Then we called the front desk and asked if they were aware of any problems expecting them to be apologetic and maybe even having us move to another hotel. No reaction. They said they'd send someone up to our room. No one ever came so I went downstairs to try to find some potable water. When I turned on the faucet in the ladies down stairs-- same thing! Disgusting. I asked the front desk person if they knew of any plumbing problems and she said no but called her manager. When she was finally able to track someone down by phone he said that yes by the way they had shut the water off earlier in the day and this happens. We should let the water run a while and it should be fine. We never received an apology. No one ever checked up on us to find out if the situation had been resolved. Nothing. Very, very disappointed.

There is no insulation to guard against noise. Didn't get a good nights sleep at all. The heating unit is one of those in the wall units that only heats the immediate area which wouldn't be a problem if Texas was not having an ice storm that day so it was freezing!

The toilet in one of the bathrooms did not work properly, and the other bathroom's toilet had a broken handle. I called, but they were never fixed properly. 4. One evening we came back rather late to find our door \"unlocked.\" Our three year old granddaughter pulled on the handle before we inserted the key and it just opened. 5. I called about the lock but nobody showed up when we asked. The next day we called again and I was told they would send someone \"right out.\" After waiting we left with the hope that our belongings would not be disturbed we left for the park as nobody arrived. 6. The day of check out, we were awakened at 9:20 to make sure we were leaving. At 10:50, another knock on the door asking if we were leaving. I said yes, within 30 minutes. I asked if I had to check out and she said \"no, just leave the key cards.\" While waiting for my daughter to finish, I stripped the sheets from the bed, vacuumed the carpet, swept the kitchen floor, my husband emptied the trash, placed the towels in one area, etc. and took our bags to the van. At 11:20 the phone rang and a woman â€œcheck-out time is at 11:00.â€� By then, I was livid. I proceeded to tell her I was aware of the time and she was the THIRD person who asked when we were leaving and rattled off the requests that I had and were not fulfilled. I also told her I began cleaning the room while waiting to leave. She told me â€œquit taking it personally.â€� I replied I am not taking it personally but I am insulted that this is the third notice for a twenty minute delay. Two of the notices began prior to the check-out time, I said when I get home; I will post how I was treated on Trip Advisor. Her response was â€œdo what you have to do.â€� She was unapologetic the entire time. She also asked how she is supposed to know that I had been contacted twice before, I suggested they improve their communication system.","date":"2012-09-03 21:30:26 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":3,"Rooms":4,"Service":1,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Reanna Hettinger","content":"We stayed here in December 2011 based on a recommendation from a friend. I had asked (via Facebook) for any recommendations for a condo to stay while in the Disney area. We were traveling with our two young children, my mother, and my sister, and thought a condo would be a better option than the two hotel rooms we had booked nearby. After speaking to my friend and thoroughly researching the property here in tripadvisor, we decided to give it a shot. I am glad we did - we stayed three nights in a three bedroom in Building 3 and were very comfortable. We had a couple of minor issues - the kitchen sink was emitting a strange smell and there were some items under beds and the couch that likely could have been cleaned up with a more thorough cleaning crew. We didn't make a big deal of the sink since we were rarely at the condo, though I am sure they would have at least checked it out if we had called it in. We just returned from a second three night stay yesterday and again had a very pleasant experience. This time it was just us and the kids, though we did have a three bedroom again (Building 2 this time, on a high floor - nice view) because it was a last minute trip and evidently the two bedrooms are booked early. No matter, the nightly rate was still more reasonable than just ONE room at any of the hotels (at least any that we would want to stay at) nearby and we saved money just by having a kitchen and washer\/dryer. Additionally, our sanity was saved thanks to our kids being able to have a separate room. I noticed a similar cleanliness issue on this trip - trash was found under one of the beds that really should not have been there - makes you wonder what else is missed. Additionally, the bathrooms seem to be showing some wear and tear and could have used a good caulking - but this is typical for the humidity of Florida (we live in the state as well and have similar issues in our bathrooms). We did not take advantage of the pool on either trip, but it looks like a great place to have some fun. We also did not do breakfast - I have seen a lot of people complaining about the lack of variety, but this is a continental breakfast that is included in the room rate, I don't see why that warrants a complaint. It is just as easy to drive to the Publix that is five minutes away and get some healthier options and eat in your own condo, on your own time, without being crowded. Additionally, after reading the negative reviews on the park shuttles, we opted to drive ourselves to the theme parks and felt that this really was the way to go. Bottom line is that this is a very affordable place to stay, generally clean, and extremely convenient to the parks, without making you a slave to the Disney property. We will never stay anywhere else when we go to Disney.","date":"2012-05-05 07:02:23 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":4}},{"author":"Lexus Terry","content":"Very nice condo-like resort convenient to all Disney Resorts and other attractions.

I loved having 3 bathrooms. I was able to purchase my park tickets there so another convience!!! THe only thing I did not like was that there wasn't a kiddie pool at the time, especially because we had 3 under 6 but oh well.

We were impressed with how friendly and helpful the front desk staff members were, greeting us each day and taking the time to talk to our boys. The daily housekeeping service was delightful - loved not having to do dishes while we were on vacation! The location was perfect - close and convenient to Disney, as well as area eateries, yet once we drove through the gates, we felt like we left everything behind us. The only downside we could find was the free resort shuttle to Disney, as it offered limited pick up and drop off times that did not coincide with our boys' nap schedule. While we ended up driving to Disney each day, it was a very easy drive and truly wasn't a big problem for us. Driving allowed us to come and go as we pleased, which in the end worked out better.

We stayed in building 1 in a 3 bedroom suite, and let me tell you it has all the room you need. We have stayed in Disney before and this was our first experience outside the park...Completely worth it, especially when you have a larger group so you don't have to be sitting on top of each other like in the disney resort....and for half the cost. The staff was very friendly and happy to help us anytime we needed anything. We opted to decline the daily room service...we were perfectly capable of washing our own towels and keeping it tidy. The pool was beautiful and never overcrowded..great music playing all day long. We stayed on the ground level and you would think there would be some noise...nope! very quiet. Something you definetly want to have is a car. Super Walmart is a couple of miles away and you can stock up on food (there is no restaurant at the resort) and supplies. All the Disney hot spots are literally only 5-10min drives from the resort (the resort does have shuttles but we loved the flexibility of coming and going as we pleased). The complimentary breakfast was nice so you could get up and get a quick bite and be on your way. I would also suggest you stay in building 1,2,or 3 just because they are closest to the pool. I have nothing but good things to say about this resort and while everyone is entitled to their own opinion I found some of the negative and pretentious ones on trip advisor to be unfounded.

I was here for a conference the last week in June, and didn't have a say on where to stay, and was concerned about the reviews I read, but was hoping it was better than others thought. The most negative of the reviews were right on!! The first night, the a\/c in the room was non-existent, and the room would not cool off. We called several times, and they told us to radically lower the thermostat, which had no real effect. We then asked to have a fan sent up, which they did after some time. We then asked the next night to have a different room, which was somewhat better, but we luckily kept the fan, or it wouldn't have been usable. The minibar in both rooms was set up so that you couldn't use it to store other cold items without being charged $25.00; even Red Roof Inn have usable mini refrigerators in their rooms! The problems continued - the conference I attended ran out of coffee after 1\/2 hour, and the hotel, claiming to take care of this, did nothing until the 2nd day, at which time they still provided inadequate coffee. The hotel staff, other than one young man, were surly and ineffectual. To top things off, in the new room my wife opened the nightstand and found that someone had left a sexual device there! I couldn't make this stuff up! The cleaning staff obviously didn't do their job. We returned the sexual device to the front desk, and didn't receive any formal apology about this. Then after the second night, the comforter that was on the bed was taken, and when the room was made up, the comforter was never returned! 7 phone calls later, on the 4th day we were there, they finally brought a comforter, but it was a full size (the bed was a King), and it was wet! We returned that. For our hassles, the hotel did provide us a free dinner, but the restaurant had horrible service on the terrace, and the young waitstaff acted as though they had never waited on any customer before. I should also mention that the rooms were small. The pool was not handicap accessible, there were two staircases of 10 stairs each leading down to it, in a very inaccessible spot. There were no soda or snack machines anywhere on any floor. They charged 50 cents a minute for computer access in their \"business\" center. Once people found that out, they didn't use it, and it was empty, although the hotel employed a person to sit there and provide service (mostly fielding angry comments about the cost). They charged $ per day for wireless internet access, which is incredibly cheap. On check out, there were hassles with the hotel charging me several Massachusetts taxes, even though I had documentation that because it was a Federally Funded Conference I should not be charged state lodging taxes. Other people at the convention I attended had the same problem. The quality control at this Hyatt is obviously very subpar.","date":"2015-12-21 07:22:59 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":2,"Overall":1,"Service":1,"Sleep Quality":1,"Value":1}},{"author":"Ernest Quitzon","content":"Just stayed here for a business\/family trip.

However, we had NO problems at the Hyatt! First of all, there is an elevator that takes you from the street level to the lobby. Then another elevator that takes you up to the rooms. Some people were complaining about this feature, but this is becoming more and more common in larger hotels. It also adds an element of security to your stay. One evening as we were walking from the main elevator to the guest elevator, a stationed Hyatt employee stopped us, and asked to see our room card before boarding the guest elevator. A comforting touch nonetheless. Check in was a breeze. Got the room we requested, and everything was smooth. Julia at the desk was extremely nice and courteous. When we got up to the room (10th floor), the room halls were very cool. Its interesting how they designed it. Blocks of 4 or 5 floors are kind of exposed.. you can look up once you get off the elevator and see the other floors (or down). it has a eurpoean\/bavarian forest type of feel in a way! it was kind cool, and unexpected. The room was very clean. The bed was VERY soft. the LCD tv was brand new. the view was even decent. we self parked ourselves... (i believe this was $32 for the single weekend day\/night we stayed for). From what i read on the website, i think valet at the hotel, was $42. the parking garage is extremely convenient. at about midnight we ventured to the bar at the hotel.. not a seat remaining. There are tables that are seat yourself to the right of the bar, that are staffed by waiters. we sat and looked at a menu for a late snakc as we just had gotten back from fenway, and decided the late night menu wasnt exactly what we were looking for. Not to mention in the 10 minutes we were there, no one approached us. So we went to Dylan and Max's... about 3-4 minutes down the street. cool, low key bar. Great bar food! The location of the hyatt is interesting. It's suprisingly convenient. The T is really close. The Common is a block away. You are just a block or two from Chinatown section, and you are 'in' the financial district. In my opinion, this isnt really the financial district. We usually stay at Club Quarters. IMO, THAT is the financial district. The Hyatt is more on the fringe i would say. it took about 10-12 minutes to get to fanuiel hall, etc. not too bad. There are stores very close by (dunkin donuts, cvs, tons of retail). I must add that they were SOLD OUT (overbooked actually) the night we stayed... And we had no service issues, nor did we hear anyone else through the walls, floors, ceilings, etc. we had no complaints! The Hyatt's reputation here MAY BE what's hurting it the most. The hyatt is known for its plush accomodations and catering to the higher end. Im thinking this could be it's downfall on the review boards in many instances. We rated the hyatt as very comparable to the other 3.5 to 4 star hotels we have stayed at in Boston and NYC... Clean. Comfy, and conveneint. We really saw no issues!","date":"2014-06-17 05:27:02 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":4}},{"author":"Maude Nolan","content":"I had previously lived in Boston and this trip was to meet up with some friends from that time frame. I opted to stay at a hotel as, when booking through Travelocity, the cost of some of the flights to Boston from DC was the same as the flight and a few nights hotel stay as I was only there for 2 nights. That being said, I was already family with the area. One of the first things I noticed and really appreciated was the travel sized toothpaste that was in the bathroom. Sure, this is small detail but most places just seem to give you shampoo, lotion and soap and I had forgotten toothpaste so this was a nice convenience. I was also able to check in a few hours early which was nice since the trip was so short. The bed was nice and comfortable. I could have sleep forever but this did not happen as it seemed every morning nearby rooms were being vacuumed before\/right around 9am. The AC rattled a lot and the pipes were noisy when the shower was going in neighboring rooms but other than that, the room was very quiet at night. I had a few drinks one night at the restaurant in the hotel as it was a Sunday night and no other restaurant in the vicinity of the hotel was going to stay open as late. The lobby area is weird but not that inconvenient as its just two elevators to get to your room not too sets of stairs. The area is right in the Downtown Crossing\/Theater District area so you will see interesting characters if you return to your hotel late at night but I never felt unsafe and knew before hand that the area is not the worst area that a young female could find herself in. The location actually worked quite well as it won't take you long to get to the airport, shopping, Faneuil Hall, Cambridge and any other popular touristy spot.","date":"2013-01-08 11:31:17 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":5}},{"author":"Augusta Cronin","content":"We stayed here for 5 nights having booked the hotel as part of a package through British Airways. The price was a major influence in our selection, it was the cheapest central hotel they offered. It was only after that we read more of the reviews and began to get worried. We took a taxi from the airport and the doorman offered to help us with the bags on arrival but we declined. The entrance is strange, the lobby is on the third floor so you need to take a lift (there are 3) from the ground. However, to get to these from the street entrance you need to go down a small flight of stairs which was a pain with the luggage (we wished we had used the bellboy)! Also these doors don't really open properly, they are stuck open at an angle which you can walk through without luggage. If the doorman is there they manage to force them open. Check in was a breeze there was no queue and the agent Rosario, was so helpful making sure that our requests had been fulfilled and offering further help and information. It was then, however, we found out that the pool was shut for renovations which had overrun. This was disappointing for us as we do like to chill in the pool normally. However, Rosario explained they had an agreement with the Langham should we wish to use a pool although as it happened, Boston kept us so occupied we didn't have time. We were on the 19th floor which pleased us and there were four lifts, which although were a bit creaky, were always working and we never had a situation where we had a long wait. The room was very spacious and clean and well maintained. It was, however, a little dated and this is reflected throughout the hotel but not to any extent that disappointed us. We had absolutely no issues with noise at all. Every member of staff we met was always friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Even after we had checked out the staff on the front desk were more than happy to give us a key to use the sauna and fitness suite so we could shower before our flight home. We found the location to be ideal. It is on top of Downtown Crossing subway station and Boylston was only a couple of minutes walk too. So many of the attractions were such a short distance anyway that sometimes it was just quicker just to walk. There is also an alternate entrance through Macy's (an alternate set of 3 lifts take you down to there). All in all we had a very good time in Boston and was very pleased with the Hyatt as a choice of hotel.","date":"2014-04-06 14:40:49 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Joana Steuber","content":"First of all this hotel is refusing to take responsibility for stolen items under the valets care.

The Boston Ballet (at the Opera House) is right across the street, which was very convienent. The room itself was nice, with very comfortable beds (my friend said they were a little too soft though, but I thought they were great). Their fitness center is also decent, with a selection of cardio equipment (4 treadmills, a few ellipticals, bikes and rowing machines), as well as weights and weight machines.

Decor is dated, rooms are quite standard and for some inexplicable reason- I was put in a handicapped room.

To boot, I could not get the phone in my room to work properly as I could only manage to work it with the speaker micro on. Additonally, their minibar bar prices are stratospheric. The bar and resutrant in the Hotel Lobby is quite generic with nothing to make it stand out in one's mind. I stayed there because when I think Hyatt- I hink of a pleasant Atrium Area but, if there was one, I did not find it.

I upgraded to an ocean front room when I made the reservation. When I checked in I was told that the room I booked (two double beds) was not available due to \"damage\" and they had put us in an ovean front room with one King bed and a pull out couch. I as disappointed about the change, but they discounted the upgrade by $10.00 per night, which I appreciated. When we got to our room on the 6th floor it was clean but not up to the standards of a room we would normally stay in. If I had paid full price for the stay I likely would have checked out right then and went someplace else. The shower head was pulled from the wall, corner molding pulled from the wall, faucet was leaking\/dripping and the room just felt run-down. You can read the other reviews about the place needing updates, I agree. THe best part of the room was the view of the ocean, and my children really enjoyed that. My older son appreciated the free wi-fi and it worked well for him. The pool area was great and my younger son and I spent most of our time there. They really seem to put alot of effort into making sure he outside of this hotel looks nice. I would suggest that they do all the pool maintenance and cleaning of the area before the pool opens at 8 am. I had to move all of my stuff one morning so that a maintenance guy could hose down\/wash the windows in the meeting area. I think he should have done this before the pool opened. I found the front desk\/restaurant\/bar staff to be very friendly and interesting to talk to. The staff is likely the best part of the hotel, followed by the pool area. In the end, I am glad I got over my initial dislike of the place because it ended up to be a good stay. I hope they continue with the upgrades and improvements.","date":"2014-05-25 15:17:03 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":4,"Overall":3,"Rooms":3,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.hotelmparis.com\/","vacancy":true}

I read some of the reviews and they were fairly positive so I was surprised at how disappointed I was. First, the hotel is old and it looks and smells moldy; they are renovating so maybe they will take care of the smell. The receptionists at check-in were unpleasant at best. They did not make eye contact and acted like we were a nuisance. We were not told about any features of the hotel - the pool, the restaurant, the bar, amenities, etc. Our room was okay. It had a kitchenette, which was nice, but the fridge leaked so whatever you put in there got filled with water within hours. The freezer was so full of ice it could not be used. There was a microwave, sink and shelving. The room was a decent size and looked fairly clean but the bathroom had mold on the walls and the tile in the shower was literally crumbling. The water coming out of the shower was hot and came out fast - a big plus, but we did not have a tub stopper so we had a heck of a time giving our baby a bath. On a least two occasions, housekeeping did not leave us fresh towels or coffee and when we called the front desk to ask for some they told us they only had one working dryer and we would have to wait until the towels were washed. The patio was small but it faced the ocean which was nice. What wasn't nice were the other tenants that were smoking all around us which made sitting on the patio (and by the pool) unpleasant. The hotel is within walking distance of the boardwalk and ocean shops. The pool was clean but the shallow, three-foot area for kids was very small which made it difficult for my six-year-old to play. There was a one-foot baby pool that was filled with stagnant water - gross. The restaurant on site, Atlantic Jacks, was terrible. We had Groupons to use so we decided to have dinner there the first night. We were the only people there (which should have clued us in that this was not a good place to eat). We ordered and never got our food. We waited 20 minutes, I asked the server where our food was and she laughed. My daughter got bored and crawled under the table and announced that there was gum under the table. We got up and left. We decided to use our Groupons at the bar instead - they didn't have wine and the bartender didn't have what he needed to make most of the drinks they advertised on their sign. He got irritated when I asked him to put cherries in my daughter's Shirley Temple. The bar is connected to the restaurant so if you eat in the restaurant, be prepared to smell smoke. We found out on our sixth day there that they had a breakfast buffet. We spent $30 for, basically, a continental breakfast - cold bacon, cold sausage, toast, danishes covered in fruit flies from the bar, fruit, hard biscuits and hard, cold waffles. The elevators, stairs and parking are a MAJOR safety concern and I will be writing a letter to their corporate office about my observations. The stairwells run on the outside of the hotel and the doors leading to the stairs and to the rooms are unlocked so anyone with ill intentions can hide there. As a woman, I didn't feel safe using the stairs. Plus, they reeked of urine. Secondly, the elevators are very dangerous. The doors close very quickly and the safety feature that lets you wave a hand in front of the door to keep it from closing was not working so my family and I almost had arms and legs crushed by the door, literally. With two kids, bikes, a stroller, a beach tent, etc., it took a minute to get off the elevator and one time the door closed on my arm as I was holding my daughter's hand. She was still in the elevator and I had to put my body in the door of the elevator and push it open. My daughter was screaming and I was completely panicked. The same thing happened to my husband. The other safety concern I had was that we had to park across the street in the overflow lot. I did not feel safe walking there by myself. My husband had to make numerous trips there and he was often stopped by homeless people asking for money. And, it was across the street from Lollipops Gentlemen's Club. Not something I want my six-year-old to see. On our last night there, someone set fire to the dumpster that was right below our room. It could have easily caught the hotel on fire. No one was alerted, the smoke alarms did not go off but the next day, the entire dumpster and surrounding wooden shed it was encased in was burnt to a crisp. Other observations - The pool did not have a bar and the bar did not open until 5; no one was monitoring the pool so there were a few times where unruly kids were carrying on and being obnoxious; we got hassled by some guy as we were entering the building one night (not sure if he was staying there or if he was homeless); dogs are allowed so you may be kept awake by barking; elevators are slow (there are only two); the beach in front of the hotel was great - clean and quiet; the air conditioner fan ran all night which was great for us; the beds and pillows are very firm. We will not be staying at this hotel again or recommending it to others.","date":"2012-05-17 05:56:16 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":3,"Overall":2,"Rooms":2,"Service":1,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":2}},{"author":"Miss Bria Bruen","content":"We have stayed at many hotels in the area and none can compare to this one.

I've seen more lavish spreads at other ES properties, but the bartender was efficient and moved the line quickly. The breakfast was fantastic, nice selection of fruit, pastries, cooked-to-order eggs\/omelets as well as french toast. If you did not want to wait, the scrambled eggs were real, not powdered, and cooked with some seasoning. It was a nice touch. The room was typical of most Embassy Suites, the pillows were nice and firm, the bathroom was clean, though a bit small. As with many Hilton properties, the WiFi is not free, not was it particularly fast. (The gentleman checking us in comped it for us!) The atrium, found in many properties, can create a somewhat noisy environment, and it seems like these properties are full frequently. We were tucked away in a corner, so noise was not an issue. The pool area was crowded, and the water was quite chilly, but it was clean and towels were stocked frequently.

A birthday present for him. We were going for the car race and thought it would be closer to access a shuttle to the track and I have read positive things on TA about the gaming so thought we would give it a try. I chose a junior cabana suite thinking it would be worth paying a little extra. The decor was modern and funky. Fun to hang out in the room although a little small for a suite. I agree with others on here that the slots appear to be looser than other hotels we have stayed at in recent years and the blackjack pays 3:2 but in our experience quite hard to beat the dealer\/house. Most staff in the casino were pleasant but others appeared to be tired and uninterested in their job or the customers in front of them. We found the staff in the Cortez cafe and Flame restaurant were great. It was the hostess in the Flame restaurant that retrieved the information for the shuttle to the race track when we asked at dinner although the bellman and front desk staff had been unable to do so earlier in the day. All staff were very friendly on our visits to both restaurants. The food was exceptional in the Flame restaurant. I would say the lamb chops are a must try as is the scampi and linguini. Meals in the cafe were great and excellent prices and you can use your comp. dollars in both restaurants. There is a walkway from the El Cortez to Freemont that has been refurbished which made it much less scary than I expected. I must admit this was one of my main concerns about staying there was the walk to Freemont at night as it seems a bit out of the way. Looked like a road a less traveled and not so well lit. I am not normally a fussy person or one to complain but this time I felt strongly about the poor housekeeping service and this place being advertised as the only \"boutique hotel\" in the Freemont district. The first morning, inspite of the Do Not Disturb sign posted on the door the maid was trying to enter the door to our room as I was walking out of the bathroom which she apologized for as she looked down at the sign. Thank goodness I was dressed. I assured her we would be leaving soon. Two days later the maid was knocking loudly on the door at 0930 hrs, again I informed her we would soon be leaving soon. I thought Vegas was about staying up late & sleeping in but not here I guess. It appeared the bathroom? or the toilet was being cleaned, we doubt the shower was cleaned, but the water was left running in the toilet on two of the five days. We arrived back about supper time and could only assume it had been running for several hours as it was obvious that the maid arrives fairly early in the morning. So much for water conservation in the desert. Second to our last day we returned that to a poorly made bed, dirty glasses and a dirty coffee cup left on the counter. We wanted to relax and have a drink in our room before heading out and thought a clean glass might be in order, I called down to the front desk who put me through to housekeeping and they said they would send someone up with clean glasses. This person did not arrive so when my husband went out for his cigarette he complained to the woman at the front desk about our disappointment in the poor service and within about 10 minutes the maid was at the door with glasses. By that time he had washed them in the bathroom sink and turned her away in frustration. Too little too late. Boutique hotel maybe but not the service one would expect, Next time I will pay less and return to one of the hotels I have stayed at in the past that have provided much better service for less money. I might return to the El Cortez for dinner and a little slot play but I would not stay there again. There is way too much competition in Vegas these days to not expect decent housekeeping service and clean glasses in your room. By the way very friendly security staff outside the cabana suites building 24\/7 which we appreciated as you have to walk outside and cross the street to this building. Overall had a great time in Vegas as usual.","date":"2012-08-10 10:12:55 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":3,"Overall":3,"Rooms":4,"Service":2,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Leon Gaylord","content":"This hotel is about a block from the \"old\" strip.

The security guards from the Hotel and the downtown area are doing a great job, even patrolling the Hotel floors. The Hotel dated back from 1941 and althoug it was renovated, it's still pretty old, so don't expect too much (except clean rooms of course) of it.If you are taking you're date on a romantic trip to Vegas or planning Honeymoon I would recommend staying at another Hotel.","date":"2015-10-20 08:01:37 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":"Île-de-France","url":"http:\/\/www.sublimeiffel.com\/","vacancy":true}

You must also use your room pass card to access the building. Room had 42\" flat screen, pillow top bed with three king size pillows, mini fridge, coffee maker and deluxe super huge shower, wow. My first ten minutes in the casino I hit on the Double Diamond quarter machine, fity cent bet got me two hundred dollars in quarters. Fun! Their loose slots were mesmerizing.

We thought the food was very good, with a very good selection. Service was a bit slow at times, but everyone that worked there was very helpful and friendly. The casino is quite big and spread out. They have the usual table games, with Black Jack at $5 a hand. They have loads of new penny machines and video poker machines in all denominations. Their dollar and quarter slots are very, very old and there is almost NO selection in the quarter range. They really need to get these updated! Many of the older machines were very, very dirty. Maybe there are plans to get new machines and this might be why there is no upkeep on them, I'm not sure? I basically just played video poker, but really would have liked to play some quarter slots.

The beds were extremely comfortable. The bathroom was of adequate size, regardless what others have posted here...We're average sized guys and none of us felt confined in there. Plenty of hot water for our 3 long showers, and the drain drained properly too... The soaps, shampoos and etc were of fine quality, and supplied daily with the thick towels provided. What more could we ask for? The room was quite soundproof, and we didn't hear any noise from other guests at any time during our stay, and we slept at all sorts of hours too. The housekeepers did an excellent job of cleaning daily, so a hefty tip was in order! The casino is great for us low-rollers, and we were able to play for quite a long time on our budgets. Cocktail service was excellent too, no matter where in the casino we were. That $1 tip brings that server back often! Oh, the food was great, especially with our $5 'Fun Book' coupons. A large Prime Rib dinner with all the etc in Kitty's for $6 was primo! The breakfast buffet will have you full all day too. All the El Cortez servers were top-drawer and courteous...

After seeing the reviews and the recommendations.......we chose the El. 2\/8-2\/12 3pm check in time, but earlier check in was no problem. We had a great room (tower) with double queen beds on the 12th floor (Rm 1207) facing the strip. With our 2-4-1 coupon found in the American Casino Guide (a must to buy, but check the book when you receive it in case there are missing coupon pages if you buy thru Amazon or E-bay) and our meager slot play return, we payed $277.20 for 5 nights for a fantastic stay. Soda and ice machines on each floor. Don't put their Vegas tap water in a water bottle to save $ from buying high cost water on Fremont St or the strip. Tap water tastes horrid but suitable to brush your teeth with. Front desk clerks were sooo nice and very helpfull. They had lost our information on our stay, so thankfully I had brought a copy of our confirmation that was done thru their web site. I recommend that everyone print it out and bring it. We asked for a fridge, which was rolled in on a nice size cart that we were able to set up our own one cup coffee maker on top of. My husband loved that . Also the love seat with coffee table which he loved relaxing on after a long day of walking. The t.v was a bigger than what we saw in the other reviewers pictures and worked great with lots of channels. Again, nice to relax to for the short time spent in the room. Plenty of super hot water, great water pressure (even during peak usage times) and tub drained quickly. No water backed up. The bathroom and large window in the room opened up (4 inches) for ventilation. The beds were soooo comfy & very clean. The curtains darkened the room so we never knew what time it was in the a.m. Housekeeping never bothered us in the morning when we had the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. Great!! We were there 5 nights (including weekend) and thought we had the whole floor to ourselves because we only ran across two people in the hall on our last night. Very quiet rooms. The rooms (rugs, furniture, walls etc) were spotless and believe me, I checked under the mattress for the creepy-crawley things that were found, with pictures to prove it from other reviewers, in nice places like the Bellagio (mice) and the Luxor (bed bugs). Nothing to report!!! yea!!! In case you forget them, they provide shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash & hand soap. I tipped Housekeeping a couple of dollars each day, which I left on the bed with a note so they would know it was for them, and left them more on our last day. Please show them your appreciation. I also left them some 2-4-1 coupons that I had leftover from other downtown buffets which I'm sure they could use because they weren't just for players with cards. We won't be back for another year so no use to us. Feeling safe in the casino and area? Yes....for sure. They had security walking around and I played slots by myself until 3am while my husband retired back to the room to sleep. They also had security on the corner of Fremont & 6th Ave to watch the walkers coming back from the FSE. This is also the corner that we had to wait for our Grayline shuttle back to the airport, so we felt very safe. He actually seemed to know the regulars that were coming and going and everyone was very respectfull. We did Grayline ($14 pp) round trip because we didn't know at the time of our flight booking that the El also provides shuttles. If you use the El's shuttle, please make your rez with them as they request? They're not mind readers and need to know ahead of time of your needs to get you there in plenty of time to get thru the airports security. There's a \"lot\" of constuction going on in that area because the El is fixing up their front door entrance. The road is being torn up, I'm assuming because of the new Streamline condo's needs for bigger water\/sewer lines. This shouldn't stop you for going to the El as the strip is also always seeing a lot of construction and it's just a fact of life in Vegas. The gift shop is open 24 hrs with munchies to buy to enjoy before bed. After doing that at 3am every morning, the security at the elevator got to know that I was done for the night and wished me a pleasant beddy-bye and never said \"don't let the bed-bugs-bite\" LOL. Sorry to say I can't comment on the food other than the breakfast buffet. You'll have to find those reviews with the others. The breakfast buffet is o.k. How can they mess up scrambled eggs, sausage, cinnamon rolls and coffee anyway. Our needs are just basic for the a.m........ \"don't stop the coffee refills!!!\" Plenty of different denominations on the slot machines with a lot of the old favorites and new ones. Yes.....even the penny \"Cashman\". They were by far, looser and more available (less people) than the strip but not as loose as the \"Fremont Casino\". One bonus round on a Fremont Cashman gave me $252. Sorry, my secret as to which one. LOL!! More hits on other machines but I won't go into them as this is a review about the El. Sorry again that I can't comment on the card tables, but other reviewers have written about them. Low bets etc. The Duece ($5 for a 24 hr pass and also good on all CAT buses if going to casinos off the strip...Rio etc) is a short one block walk from the El and FSE is a quick 2 block walk. If you ride the Duece and going to the Strip, enjoy the ride from the upper level. If you're 5'7\" or taller, duck your head up there because that's how low the ceiling is. We enjoyd the sick humor of watching people, especially the men, smack their heads when they reached the top of the stairs before they realized the ceiling height.....even though there's a sign stating it. Very funny! LOL I hope I covered everything that you might need to know about the El. I tried to talk about the things \"I\" might want to ask if I was going to try a new place and hopefully covered it all. Go to the El, enjoy its comfort & super clean rooms, feel secure and save your $ for all of the other crazy things to see and do while in Vegas.

That should have been my warning but since I had no where else to go, I was stuck. To say this place is tired is an understatement. Upon entering, it took me about 10 minutes to locate the 'front desk'...which is little more than a recessed kiosk. I got to the elevator and into my room. The room was cavernous...very large and covered in old stained pink carpeting. The doors rattled and the lock didn't seem secure. At night, I wedged a chair against the door for added protection. This was a huge room but the sparse furniture in the room was all set around the walls and made the room uncomfortably large. The bed was set against one wall and the small tv was set all the way across the room on an old dresser. It was so far away, the remote didn't work unless I got out of bed and walked up a few feet. The casino itself is old...old...old. Carpeting is old, stained and tired. Much like the elephant's graveyard, I truly believe this is where gamblers to go die. I played some texas hold 'em there and true to some of the 'press' the owner sat down and played with us. He was a nice enough guy but has some serious health problems and drank himself into a stupor while playing. The drink lady obviously knew him well and had been there for years. She was visibly concerned about his health and questioned his drinking...which just aggrevated the owner. It was not a pleasant scene and was actually depressing. The owner eventually staggered away. While at the table, I struck up a conversation with the guy next to me. We were having a pleasant conversation and this particular dealer ragged on us incessantly about 'table talking'. I like social games and that's half the fun but this guy ragged us to the point that we quit tipping him. The other guy eventually told the dealer to go ---- himself and left and I followed suit. The casino is a block off from the Fremont Street Experience and block you have to cross is a concern. The cab driver warned me not to be out at night in that area. He said there were a lot of crack heads and they were known to mug people. I ended up playing downtown a lot but made my way back before dark each evening. Careful Kitty's is ok. It's an old diner. Food was alright and the service was friendly. There were lots of old tired-looking people hanging around who appeared to have health related problems. I'm truly sorry for these people but I was there to have fun and it was just depressing. I went back there once with my girlfriend to show her the place. She couldn't believe I actually stayed there. She played some slots and then said that the place 'creeped' her out and she wanted to leave NOW... I'll stay downtown anytime and actually prefer it to the strip but I'll never make this mistake again. The room was cheap but I paid a much higher price by sacrificing my enjoyment. I've been to Vegas many times and this was, by far, the worse experience I've ever had.","date":"2012-03-26 11:54:35 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":2,"Overall":1,"Rooms":1,"Service":3,"Value":1}}],"scope":"travel","state":"Île-de-France","url":"http:\/\/paris-hotel-longchamp.com\/","vacancy":false}

Vegas especially offers a very wide array of choices, so you really need to ask that all important question. Do you want glitz and glamor, pretty people and high end entertainment, spas and shopping? If so then the strip is the place to be. If I were treating myself and my wife to a fun vacation trip probably that's where we would head. Or if we were looking for just a basic, more budget minded, gamble a little play a little trip, then downtown might be our choice. This trip was a business trip, and downtown was simply more convenient, to say nothing of less costly. This was my first stay at the Fremont and it fit the bill very nicely, thank you. The room while not large was more than adequate. It was clean, as has been mentioned in some other reviews, tastefully redecorated recently. It was a nonsmoking room\/floor and I didn't detect any smoke odor in the room although a little from the main floor does make it's way into the hall around the elevator. The bed, pillows and bedding were comfortable. The bath room was small, while I had no problems, it is a one person at a time proposition. Loved the water pressure, huge plus for me. Restauranting downtown offers a pretty wide choice, I opt mostly for sandwiches etc when not entertaining. People-watching under the canopy of the Fremont Experience is almost as good as any number of the shows one can see on the strip. But as I have said this was first and foremost a business trip. The staff was extremely friendly did their job well. Housekeeping missed servicing my in-room coffee, front desk handled it in a timely fashion. Check out was a little slow with only one person on station. Al in all have to give it a thumbs up. Not fancy, but the equal of any mid-range Motel chain. I booked as a Flight\/Hotel package and was very pleased with the great value for the money.","date":"2012-12-18 06:55:02 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Eli Marquardt","content":"As mentioned in the title, I rated this hotel a \"4\" for gambling and not necessarily for the rooms, although the rooms are bit smaller than what you'd get up on the strip, the excellent gambling makes up for it all. We just recently got back from an 11\/11\/11 trip and definitely enjoyed bringing back home all the money we went up with, plus more. We enjoyed playing every single day (6 days of fun) around the clock at the Fremont and other downtown vicinity hotels. Rooms have been updated as far as the decor goes, can't change the size of the room, but it's still kept clean, no flat screen tv, but that's ok, we're not here to stare at walls 24\/7 or the TV...but strictly to play, enjoy and have a lot of fun, which we always get when staying at the Fremont. Table games, slot machines, poker machines, you name it, they got it and a lot of guests to boot, which makes this one of the best old times downtown \"happening\" hotels on the Fremont street experience. Now, don't go there expecting a 4 or 5 diamond rated room, because like I mentioned earlier, its \"old time\" Vegas, and not your spa & resort style uptown atmosphere, but the years of \"old gone by,\" where the real gamblers of past preferred staying and still do. As far as food goes, we skipped the buffet this time because most of our family vacationing there were staying at either the Main Street Station or the California (all Boyd hotels), so most meals were usually at the Main Street station hotel & casino. We did pick up some last minute in-between and after gambling eats at the open cafe where you can find a variety of fast food such as chinese, American, etc. and I can't forget to mention that huge bowl of delicious oxtail soup (with rice), you'll just have to try this one out. Also, be sure to try Tony Roma's restaurant, known to make some excellent ribs and other goodies, but, be sure to make reservations in advance. The overall happy atmosphere at this hotel is due not only to the type of guests that patronize this place, but also due to a lot of friendly, courteous and professional employees who'll help to make your stay comfortable, enjoyable and memorable. As far as parking goes, I normally only do valet in Vegas, hey, just let them park your car (it's much safer), and what's a two or three dollar tip when you'll be dropping even more into that slot machine or on that favorite table game of yours, for me, I call it convenience by getting right off at the the front door. Fremont is one of the best located downtown hotels there is with a 1 minute walk (I'm not kidding either) to Binions, Golden Nugget and the Four Queens casino & hotel. Fremont is a \"Boyds\" casino, & one can venture to it's sister properties, the Main Street Station or the California hotel & casino via a 4 - 5 min. walk down the street. Don't forget to sign up for your Bconnected players card which can also be used at all \"Boyds\" and \"Coast\" properties, and used to get \"comp\" rooms, discounts off buffets when you show your card, and at some of the sun dry shops too. Fremont is a good value for your money (it's not the Venetian) but you'll have loads of fun staying at this iconic oldie of an oldie hotel. Enjoy and happy gambling!","date":"2013-11-24 18:35:34 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":"Île-de-France","url":"http:\/\/www.hotelkeppler.com\/","vacancy":false}

Luckily one of us is very handy and fixed it. We waited about 30 minutes for the clock, but then had to get something to eat. The clock never arrived, but in the end it wasn't needed because the maid was vacuuming the hallway at 7:30am Saturday morning! Ridiculous. Koval Lane is very close to the strip, but it has a lot of VERY seedy looking apartments and derelict buildings which made me feel a little uneasy as we approached the motel. Our cards wouldn't unlock the door to the hotel which was closest to the casino and restaurant, so we had to walk all the way around it was pretty cold, so that was annoying. Ellis Island is a great restaurant-- you can tell by the line-ups and people's willingness to wait up to an hour for food. The portion size, quality and price are one of the best in Las Vegas. Skip Super 8, but have a meal at Ellis Island.","date":"2015-04-19 06:06:22 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":5,"Overall":2,"Rooms":3,"Service":3,"Value":3}},{"author":"Mrs. Alexanne Rau","content":"We stayed at this hotel twice during our USA vacation, on the day of our arrival to the USA and again on the night before our departure. We chose it because it had an airport courtesy shuttle, was within walking distance of the Strip and had a restaurant next door. We weren’t disappointed with our choice although for some people it could be too far to conveniently walk to the Strip. The rooms were well maintained, clean and large and the air conditioning was effective without being too noisy at night. On our second visit we did have a similar problem to another reviewer in that our room key malfunctioned twice and we had to call for the maintenance man to unlock the door. Whilst the rooms were clean the corridors we poorly maintained and could do with new carpets and some fresh paint and brighter lighting. The reception staff were efficient but not as friendly as many other USA reception staff. Remember, this is a budget hotel and therefore don’t expect the luxury of the larger hotels on the Strip. If you just need a room for a night then it’s OK but if you are looking for several nights luxury accommodation in Las Vegas then I’d choose elsewhere. The Ellis Island restaurant\/casino next door did a good evening meal and breakfast although be prepared to wait 40-45 mins (at 7.30pm) for an evening meal. The night we went there it was packed but they had an efficient system for turning the tables around and getting people seated. There is also a 7-11 store nearby which makes it easy to stock up with provisions.","date":"2012-10-07 15:04:10 +0300","ratings":{"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":4,"Overall":3,"Rooms":3,"Service":3,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":"Île-de-France","url":"http:\/\/www.princealbertmonceau.com\/","vacancy":true}

The rooms are mainly in single level villas, spread along various winding pathways in beautiful and immaculate gardens - so there's noise neither from above nor nearby, and it never feels crowded as you make you way through the hotel. Every detail is carefully attended to - the valet parking noticed I opened the roof on my car, so afterwards always delivered it to me with the roof ready down, the rubbish cleared out, fresh bottles of chilled water in the cup holders. The pool attendant placed a towel on the ladder the moment I dived in - and had everything from fruit to sun lotion and magazines to hand in case you wanted it. The concierges really made the place. Tickets for the Getty Villa, arrangements for the best studio tour you can get, advice on good routes to destinations for seeing interesting stuff along the way, all this and much more. The best was to describe a type of skateboard I wanted to take back as a gift, but didn't know the name of - and come back to my room to find one sitting on the desk.

Since I was going to Maui on my latest trip alone I decided to be a bit more economical and stayed at the Pioneer Inn. I'd noticed it on previous visits and a co-worker who had stayed here recommended it. The rates are comparatively very good and the location is great since I'm a big fan of Lahaina. I stayed here for 5 nights in Sept. '06 when I was on Maui for the marathon weekend races. The race starts were just a short drive up the coast...maybe 10 mins. tops which wasn't a problem at all. Not having a beach right outside my door wasn't a problem either in my case especially since I love putting the windows down on my rental car and turning up some local tunes on the radio and enjoying the drive. I went to several different spectacular beaches all up and down the coast which I think is the best way to see Maui anyway. I'd do this even if I were at one of the higher end resorts. While at the Pioneer Inn I really enjoyed getting up for sunrise in the mornings and sitting on the seawall which was right outside my door and watching Lanai light up as the sun hit it. I also enjoyed watching the local kids surfing right in front of the hotel before they went off to school in the mornings and again in the evenings. I liked the idea that the locals seemed to congregate at a small park right outside the hotel by the seawall. This spot is one of the most relaxing I have ever experienced. I enjoyed walking the streets of Lahaina in the evenings also and meeting some of the local characters...and they have their share...and you will meet them unless you make an effort not to. All of this was right there surrounding the hotel, so I loved it. As for the hotel itself, being a history fan, I enjoyed the character of the place and the old feel of it. My room was fairly large and clean if not overly plush. It's not the Westin or the Grand Wailea, but it is perfectly functional and I didn't spend much time there anyway other than to sleep. The balcony was a bit public, but that was charming to me. My room overlooked the banyan tree and I actually enjoyed hearing the birds when I sat outside. I wasn't bothered by them at all when the door was closed and I was sleeping. The a\/c in my room was fine and not loud at all as a previous reviewer noted. I liked the interior window shutters that actually worked rather than being for decoration. They do help keep out the noise and light also. The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating. I had breakfast twice in the hotel restaurant and it was very good. I recommend it. Sitting out on the lanai watching the town come alive in the morning was very nice. Parking was a couple of blocks away which you may want to know ahead of time, but it was free and walking through the streets of Lahaina is fun anyway. Had a great visit and plan to return this September. I'd recommend it to anyone not determined to stay at a luxurious resort on a beach. Those places are great too, but for a relaxed low key vacation this place is it.","date":"2012-11-11 08:29:49 +0300","ratings":{"Overall":4}},{"author":"Rowena Ledner","content":"The oldest hotel in town, the Pioneer Inn, is a local landmark. Itâ€™s smack in the middle of Lahaina. I stayed there with my wife and 3 boys (ages 11, 9, and 5). Itâ€™s not a place I would want to spend a week at, but for a night or two it has a great location while capturing the feel of Lahaina and its kooky, touristy fun. The Pioneer Inn was built in 1901 and was the only hotel in western Maui until 1964. Itâ€™s now under the Best Western banner. There is a plaque at the registration desk citing them as one of the top Best Westerns in the country. Iâ€™m not surprisedâ€¦it was definitely the best Best Western I have ever stayed at. They had a set of rules posted by the desk from when the hotel first opened. Some of them are pretty funny such as â€œIf you burn or wet you bed, you going outâ€� and â€œYou are not allow in the down stears in the seating room or in the dinering room or in the kitchen when you are drunk.â€�. Fortunately, the boys remained sober and enjoyed climbing the banyan tree next door for nearly an hour. We had a great lunch at Aloha Mixed Plate and the boys satisfied their pizza jones at B.J.â€™s that night. You will not lack for dining choices in Lahaina. Our room was a â€œsuiteâ€�, although there was no separate sitting room. It was very spacious, however. We had a king bed and a queen pull-down Murphy bed. The hotel also has pretty decent and FREE wireless high-speed Internet access. There was a small lanai that overlooks an inner courtyard. You have no privacy on the lanaiâ€”itâ€™s more a motel-like internal open hallway with the lanais separated by open wooden fences. Our room overlooking the garden was very peaceful, however. A number of rooms overlook the main drag, Front Street. I would imagine they could be pretty noisy and\/or excellent vantage points for first-class people watching, depending on your mood. The room was very clean and everything was in working order. Reception staff was gracious and friendly. All-in-all, this is no fancy resort, but is a very good value. I would definitely stay again. The morning we checked out we had excellent, plate-covering macadamia nut pancakes in the hotelâ€™s restaurant. A nice cap to a nice stay. When youâ€™re in Lahaina you look at the pretty green clapboard siding of the Pioneer Inn with its white trim and you say to yourself, â€œgee, I wish I could stay in a place like thatâ€�.

Of course, we had heard that Grand Wailea is the place to stay which is why we booked this hotel, but we did not know all of the little things this hotel had to offer that will keep us coming back here over any other hotel on the island. The grounds are truly beautiful! I was apprehensive about staying at such a large hotel at first, but it is so easy to navigate around the property and all of the different pools and slides all connect to one another. The grotto bar (in the water) is our favorite!The beach is not only beautiful on this side of the island but literally a few steps away from the pool, so it is super convient to go back and forth. They have this program at the hotel where we rented unlimited access to kayaks, paddle boarding, snorkeling gear, etc. for four days and it was totally worth the money; especially compared to the cost to purchase these types of activities outside the hotel. We also took advantage of the beautiful spa and fitness center which I only have good things to say. All of the staff were very professional and friendly from the bellmen to the maid service. After our bed was turned down at night, they would turn on the radio so you had music playing when you came in. We even didn't mind the mandatory daily valet parking, bc we could just call for our car when we knew we were leaving and it would be at the front when you arrive along with any directions you need.

Very much enjoyed the focus on artwork. Service and staff effort was first rate - except for my concierge experience I'll note later. Until the new restaurant opens, the resort only has 2 full service restaurants and both are oriented for ocean views. Its impossible to get a reservation for either resort restaurant from open to 8pm every day without advanced reservations as they are fully booked with sunset viewers. Both restaurants are good and my dinner at Humuhumu was a highlight of the trip. I'll note that this was my first trip to Maui - a place that was recommended by friends as THE island to experience a slower pace and quiet relaxation. My rooms lanai was great. I watched the sunset from there every night and I loved it. But the resort itself is busy - with alot of families with children, business conferences, etc. I saw the amenities before I arrived so I cant say this was unknown but I hoped for more in the way of adult quiet. My experience with the concierge service was much poorer than the Waldorf Astoria name would imply. I visited twice. Once inquiring how to order and ship fruit and flowers to the mainland. The other was to book a restaurant reservation for my birthday - which at that point I saw as a necessity as, previously noted, restaurant reservations in the Wailea area are tough. For the fruit and flowers inquiry I was handed a brochure that I could use to order from a local company. As much as I tried, I was looking for the concierge to understand I wanted them to arrange the order to my home address. Instead I walked away with a brochure. For my birthday dinner, since the Grand Wailea concierge doesnt appear to have access to preferred tables at their own resort - I was sent offsite to the Four Seasons. My dinner at Duo was very good - and that time at the Four Seasons resort next door showed me that it was likely the place I would visit next as it was more adult oriented and was more responsive to service requests. The Duo staff presented me with a birthday desert. The Grand Wailea, after telling the concierge I was there for my birthday, didnt present me with any greeting at all. I wasnt in Maui expecting birthday freebies but something, anything would have been nice. As many have posted, the additional costs ie parking and resort fees seem unnecessary. Include it in the room rate and be done with it. I'm a Hilton Diamond member and the lack of Diamond amenities was disappointing. The rooms are showing signs of wear, ie dented walls, chipped bathroom tiles - but these are small details. The room itself was very fine.

Then, when we complained about this, the manager told us there was nothing he could do and whoever told us that we could have more wristbands was wrong. Then, we were supposed to have the oceanview room and when we got to our room, all we could see were palm trees. The bellman told us to just move the palm trees in our head. Then, when we are in the room, our bathtub is disgusting and we complained to the housekeeping staff and nothing was done. My wife had to clean the bathtub, ON OUR HONEYMOON!!!! The shower had mold in it, the air vents were black with filth, and there was dirt on the walls itself. I know we paid the local rate but that doesn't give anyone the right to do such a poor job. When we complained to the manager, Hilme, he implied that since we shouldn't expect much since we were getting the local rate. Just because I was a savvy shopper and knew people on the island is no reason for their standards to be lax. Then, we found that the valet parking (which is mandatory) is pretty ridiculous considering they are charging 30 dollars for parking. Then, I found out that 30 dollars is not total for your stay but PER DAY, which is not mentioned anywhere, which is fraud by the way. We complained and the valet manager reversed the charges after apologizing for the \"miscommunication \". When we checked out, we complained about the many problems and the manager, Hilme again, told us that \"A hundred off is more than generous considering you got the local rate.\" Now, not only is that being prejudiced against the local Hawaiian people, that is also showing bias against their guests for being savvy shoppers. That's not even remotely approaching the level of class that we were expecting from the hotel for something that was not our mistake. I expected our stay to be comped and apologies abounding. Instead, I got apathy and rudeness. Now, I work for the Bellagio in Las Vegas and when I booked our stay, they told me that the Grand Wailea was the Bellagio of Maui. Unfortunately, from what we saw, the cleanliness and professionalism of the hotel is comparable to a low-class Days Inn. I am extremely disappointed in the level of service and customer care that we received and I will be relating that information to every guest at the Bellagio who asks for the best place to stay in Maui. I will now be referring people to the Kea Lani from now on. That \"should be more than generous\", as the manager put it. They should have cleaned the room thoroughly. They should not have defrauded and deceived people about the price of parking and if they were gonna charge for parking, they should have offered the option of self parking.

For what was supposed to be a relaxing afternoon with my husband at the spa, due to the poor customer service we experienced, it soured everything and I wish we had never gone. In addition, there were foreign gardeners right outside my massage room, chattering away, so it made for a very un-relaxing experience. Also, my massage therapist was just average- I thought their standards would be higher. When we complained to the spa manager on duty afterwards, she was very indifferent, like she didn't care. She gave us coupons to use their hydrotherapy again (which I believe is free to use with any service), which we will not use. We will not waste our valuable vacation time there again.

It's almost as if they know their jobs are unstable and have just stopped caring. I've never experienced such a lack of customer service skills in my life. It's as if your very presence is some sort of inconvenience.

In the short time since our previous visit I was disappointed and dismayed to find how much the Resort has slipped in its appearance and performance. Housekeeping is truly less that thorough with dirty bathroom floors, furniture surfaces left soiled and unclean. The rooms are showing their age in terms of dinged and damaged furnishings, broken lamp shades. chips on walls and scratched, soiled painted surfaces. Cupboards not closing properly and calls for repairs unanswered. We even left the \"repair card\" which is deposited in each room by the staff to notify them of any problems and this was never tended to nor answered. The breakfast buffet has simply lost its quality and execution. Most foods tasted bland and were either under\/overcooked. Mediocre at best considering the hi price you pair for breakfast each morning in the Grand Dining Room. My biggest grip and huge shock was to see the mistreatment and disregard for guests at the main pool area (adult). 14-16 casabellas each morning with eight louge chairs a piece usurped by the staff with white towels as \"reserved for paying guests\" . Well at $1000 a day it was no surprise that only 2-3 three of these casabellas were ever rented during our week stay. This in turn left approx 96 poolside chairs unavailable to the rest of the guests who were inconvenienced and displaced out onto the lawn when the few chairs that remained poolside were grabbed up by guests as early as 7a.m. Not a person in sight to assist guests when they had to shuttle chairs out onto the lawn since nothing was left poolside and again only 2-3 casabellas occupied with 8 chairs each UNUSED. This is ridiculous and a slap in the face to paying guests who are already shelling out a minimum of $500\/nite to stay here. 96 chairs left unusable ALL DAY LONG just in case someone MIGHT rent them and NO ONE did. This is completely unacceptable, bad business and the poorest way to treat guests. We all understand the economy is bad, but should paying guests be put out, put off and displaced by the uncertain hope\/wish that maybe just MAYBE someone will rent a casabella and take the 8 chairs, or should they make a policy that unless one is reserved by the night before or 9a.m. that morning the rest should be left open and the 8 chairs they contain available to all guests . This has left a huge distaste in my mind and feeling that we will not be returning let alone recommending others to visit. Its a shame, the place was once magnificent and held it guests with the highest regard, always very accomodating and offering to make you comfortable. This seems to have disappeared.","date":"2014-06-27 23:30:09 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":2,"Location":4,"Overall":3,"Rooms":2,"Service":2,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":2}},{"author":"Brandy Abbott","content":"I was there in Grand Wailea for 4 days during second week of June.

The grounds are lush. The pool are clean and refreshing. There are separate areas for kids and adults. The beach is groomed each morning. Snorkeling right off the beach is enjoyable. But try to bring your own snorkel gear as itâ€™s $12\/ day to rent it. Which brings me to the point of my review: paying for everything. WOW, the prices. Rum & Coke, $12. Mai Tai, $14.

Yes, I understand that itâ€™s not an all-inclusive. But after staying at Sandals and Beaches, we paid less than at Grand Wailea. I know this review goes against the grain of most reviews.

I had already planned surfing lessons at Blue Hawaiin and the luau at Old Lahaina both were well worth the money and trip to lahaina. The thing that I can advise is plan ahead - dont waste a half a day with the concierge and it is more expensive through them. upon arrival we were greated by Rosie who was very friendly- you have probably read reviews about her- but she only said aloha Check in was a different story, being hilton honors members and taking 2 rooms for 10 nights didnt get us a thing we were in rooms 5118 and 5120 not a great view - too low if you are in this part of the hotel, you have to be ready to walk to the main pool and beach area it is far!! if you are having health issues definately ask for a closer room- you may go through the grand ballroom for your car but this is a very large hotel and spread out-the room was slightly dirty some mold in bathrooms but after talking to housecleaning they took care of it during turn down service - which i personally love I got sick there with strep throat and went to the clinic in kehei- they couldnt have been nicer at clinic however when we ordered room service that was an eye opener! expensive is too mild-holy cow for 1 mozzerella appetizer, four soups, house salads and 4 sodas i spent almost $180! then the second night my daughter got fish and chips with a bone in it that could've killed her! no exaggeration!! it was the size of a tooth pick and as sharp! they said that we wouldnt be charged but I am still fighting that one with them-the rush for the pool chairs is certainly true unless you are willing to pay $300\/day for a cabana-which seem to take up all the space around all of the pools - you can get chairs however by the adult pool near the beach and the staff there were great they expected to be tipped but at least they smiled and made you feel good about spending money to sit down if you can get the breakfast buffet it is worth the money, although I must agree with reviews about the birds - too many and it is a health concern we watched them cr.. on the tables next to us the hotel should consider netting-one more thing - i booked photos with the hotel photographer, at sunset on our last day there - that didnt turn out well-he double booked and he tried to divide his time with us and them the other family complained quite loudly and took over the session - I am currently waiting to see if he gives us the discounted rate that he promised to - the hotel is absolutly breathtaking and there is a premium for that beauty one of the nicest places on the island of maui and the property is immaculately maintained the pools are fantastic and they even have manicure and pedicure services poolside along with popcorn and slushies! the restaurants are great but you would do better eating out if you are looking to save money somewhere hard rock in lahaina was really good and less then half the price of the grand wailea the pizza place across the street from hotel, matteos, was not new york pizza so we did not care for the sauce at all - plus im italian so its hard to compare any gravy to mine haha the overall feeling from the people on maui is laid back, kind and considerate great vibe from almost everyone i dont want you to think that we didnt have a fantastic time, we did i just thought that you would want to hear about these things so that you can be better prepared when you step off the plane onto paradise!","date":"2014-04-16 00:09:26 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Overall":4,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Victoria Wiegand","content":"Staying at the Grand Wailea is definitely an experience. The grounds are phenomenal, the rooms are gorgeous and the staff is helpful and will do just about anything for their guests. The pools are spectacular. This resort is just about perfect. My family (2 kids ages 6 and 9) had a great time. However, perfection comes with a price. A standard mixed drink at the pool and lobby bar was $14.00. Regardless of price, if you are hanging out at the pool and use the slides from pool to pool, one should invest in the cool plastic Pineapple container for your drinks ($21.00 initially and $14.00 for cocktail refills). It has a handy sealed lid to keep your drink somewhat safe as you slide from pool to pool or if you drink too much. Once you get home, the pineapple doubles as a piggybank for the kids or your next trip back to the Grand Wailea. The Spa Grande is one of the nicest spas I have ever been to. The Terme baths are unique! Here's the stuff you may or may not care to know: The daily resort fee was $20.00 plus valet parking is mandatory at the resort at an additional $25.00 per day...not to mention every time you want your car, you have to fork over more money for a tip for the valet. Our room contained a king size bed and a pull out couch for the kids. The first night we had to put sheets on the pull out couch. Fortunately, the sheets and blanket were neatly sealed in a box in the closet. I am not super high maintenance but it would have been nice for the staff to recognize our reservation would be using the pull out couch and prepared accordingly for our arrival. The bed for my husband and I was super comfortable and we slept well but the mattress topper had obviously hills and valleys in it which to me indicates wear. Again, I am not the type who is going to demand for my bed to be ergonomically redesigned for my liking on vacation, so I just dealt with it. Other than my small complaints, The Grand Wailea is awesome. The Grand is not necessarily for those who are frugal like myself.

We used that link to upgrade, for free, to the Napua Tower. The Napua Tower is like the Executive Level. They have a good breakfast in the morning and appetizer in the evening. The service is great. House Keeping did a great job and our room was very clean. Another Tip - At The Whaler's General Store in The Shops at Wailea (a short drive\/walk from the Hotel) you can pick up some reasonably priced snacks, drinks and deli. I was surprised the prices on most items were cheaper than the local super markets in Kihei. Finally, the greeter at the front (Rose Sumibcay) was very cool. She was very kind and engaging and my 9 year old daughter looked forward to seeing her everyday to \"talk story\".

The pricing is what the pricing is and I feel that if you stay here you should have known that going in and thus you are not allowed to complain. I found the staff to be very pleasant individually but something just doesn't click here? It may be that it is so large that it all just doesn't connect, or come together as complete. The grounds are spectacular and easy to navigate, just be prepared to walk. Take in all that is around you, there is plenty to look at! The pool area was crowded but it was not a problem finding chairs, even after 11:00 am. There is limited space around any pool no matter how big, if you want to be pool front get up and get out! There was lovely lawn area with plenty of chairs and it was just fine and a short walk to the pools...just wear your $@!#% flops, as the walkway is sooo hot! Not the GW's fault! The beach is shared by 3-4 hotels and, though lovely, it is not huge and it gets packed!!! We went into the ocean but parked ourselves by pool and lawn. We ate at Humu and the pool area restaurant. Humu, with the $40 coupons was a fairly reasonable value and a great atmosphere. We had 3 rooms so we had $120 worth of coupons. Our dinner for 6, after coupons, was just over $200! This included some apps and drinks. Don't drink as much as us and use your free drink coupons with dinner, not before, and it is even less! We all felt it very good. The pool area food and bar was as expected, just fine. My daughter loved the spa treatment and, again after using the 20% off coupon, thought it was reasonable at about $125 for a 50 minute message and one hour use of other facilities included. The gym was large and we were there at peak time and waited for no machine. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable. We were in the back building and on the 6th floor and had a great view! I liked the bed though others with us thought they were to soft. If you take the down mattress cover off, or ask housekeeping to, it will be more firm. One thing to note, the lovely bathrooms were adorned with a throw rug that had no rubber backing in front of the sink!!! REMOVE IT if they have not yet changed them all out. I took a pretty good fall, after ignoring a slip or two prior. I was lucky to only twist my ankle and bruise my elbow pretty good- enough to miss my scheduled golf event with son. I can only imagine if it was someone older or less able to control the fall. I mentioned this to front desk and though my rug was immediately changed out to one with rubber backing the other two rooms we had were not! I was clearly not the first by the look on the faces of those I mentioned it to. Though I was looking for nothing, I was surprised by the apparent lack of concern when discussed with security. Would I stay again, yes I would. It was a lovely place.","date":"2015-08-10 19:43:48 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Overall":4,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Destini Lakin","content":"The grounds of the hotel are beautiful, but the hotel itself is pretty dated.

The thing about the GW is there's NO reason to ever leave the property. You have beautiful beach, SEVEN swimming pools, a pool bar, and incredible restaurants. The layout of the hotel is awe-inspiring as well. Basically everything IS expensive, and it's because you're receiving the best of the best. Just down the beach are two other famous, upscale resorts: The Four Seasons and the Fairmont. While each are also impressive in their own ways, they just don't compare because the pools at the GW are so epic.

Our room was clean the king bed was comfortable and the staff did a wonderful job keeping us stocked with towels. The beach is gorgeous and water park pool fun! Weakness included inconsistent customer service, food, grounds and employee attitudes, plus the ever present nickel and dime charging. My wife wasnâ€™t impressed by the spa she went for one treatment early in our trip and never returned. Warning: The stone area around the pool is slippery witnessed several adults and children slipping and falling on the stone tile surrounding the upper pool area. Also there is a lack of shade around the pools, so you need to get to the pool early in order to stake claim to a shaded standard lounge chairs. Beach goers need to arrive early before 9am to stake claim to one of the limited number of beach umbrella and lounge chairs available at no additional charge.

Upon arrival, the hotel was reportedly at about 90% occupancy. There are approximately 780 rooms to the Property. Assuming an average of 3.0 people per room this would equate to 2100 guests more or less exclusive of staff during our stay. The facilities and staff simply can not come close to servicing that amount of people to any degree, let alone to a four or five star level. The main attraction to the hotel, the pools and slides become so crowded and so chaotic by noon that it is difficult to imagine that after the initial pleasure of merely being in Hawaii wears off the mid west or east coast traveler, one doesn't feel stressed over fighting over towls and chairs and space. It is Lord of the Flies at $1,000 a day. By 7:45 am 95% percent of the chairs around the multi level pool complex are completely taken. By 8:00 am 100% are taken. No one is actually using the pool or is even at the pool at that hour however. The one hour policy to \"reserve\" your chair is not enforced and in fact I actually witnessed on Friday March 25 at approx 11:00 am two young girls ages 8 and 10 , who had claimed two chairs and were quietly sitting next to me (which had been cleared by security about 30 minutes prior due to a guest placing a book there at approx 7:00 am and quickly disappearing) removed by hotel security because the guest returned 4 hours later and claimed he had BEEN USING THE CHAIR- A BLATANT AND OBVIOUS LIE. THE YOUNG GIRLS WERE SCARED, THE 5FT 10 260LB WHITE MALE GOT HIS CHAIR BACK,because the hotel secuity made the expedient decision after looking at thesize of the belligerent male and then the two little innocent girls who would be easier to deal with and the young girls had their day ruined. You could provide that friendly spring break experience for your kids without spending a 1,000 dollars a day for room and meals! Thank God the girls parents were not there at the time or there might have been a stabbing! So much for the blind eyes of Justice! Not once by the pool in five days did a server ever ask if we were interested in placing a food order. When we did eat by the pool the food was horrible. I do not mind the prices but the food was horrendous. The rooms were fair but can not compare to any four star or five star hotel in Kona, Lanai, or even next door at the Four Seasons. It is not enough for Management to say that occupancy is 90% and things get tight. A hotel need that number in order to make money so obviously the business plan for this Hotel coupled with the size and design do not provide functional utility for the guests ,and hence, this hotel constitutes a very poor value and a terrible waste of money. Management, let me tell you something: from 7am to 10 am the amount of people that are actually using the pool and need to legtimately \"claim\" a chair for immediate use is around zero. Issue towels and chairs at 10:00am and not earlier before someone gets killed!!!","date":"2014-09-25 18:41:54 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":4,"Overall":2,"Rooms":3,"Service":1,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":1}},{"author":"Myra Mosciski","content":"My family recently stayed at the Grand Wailea for a week and we had a really nice time. We loved the resort location and we were really pleased with our room. We had a Deluxe Ocean View room that was nice and spacious, had a decent sized balcony and had great views of the ocean and pool area. Our room was very clean and the property seemed clean the entire week we were there. As others have mentioned, the rooms are pricey and everything at the resort was expensive, but it wasn't a surprise....most places in Maui are pretty pricey. We have a 3 year old son who travelled with us and he had a ball at the pool. There was so much to do (even for little ones). The spa is amazing and is a must-do for anyone who stays at or anywhere near the resort. In general we had a fantastic time, but we did make note of a couple of things that could be improved upon: - One downside to the pool was the limited number of pool chairs. People get in line at 7am to claim their pool chairs and some people leave them unoccupied for hours. The rule is one hour only, but on most days we saw chairs being left unoccupied for 2-3 hours. - Prior to our vacation we called and asked about cabana rentals and were told we wouldn't need to book a cabana in advance, that it could be booked when we arrived. Regardless of that information, we called the week before our vacation and booked a cabana near the baby beach. When we arrived at the resort we called to confirm the cabana rental and were told that they had no record of our cabana reservation. We figured they'd be a little apologetic, but they really weren't. We were then told that people book the cabanas months in advance (which was completely different from what we were told weeks prior to our trip). The upside was we saved $250 in the cabana rental for that day! - The food and drink service at the pool was hit or miss. We went an entire day without anyone coming to take a drink order. Late in the afternoon, we saw a server and my husband asked her if she could come over to get our drink order and she did, but with zero enthusiasm and customer service skills that most servers at a resort of this caliber would display. On other days we had great pool service so i guess it really just depends on the server. Everyone else at the resort was extremely friendly and our overall experience was great. We had such a lovely time we definitely plan to go back and we would stay at the Grand Wailea again.","date":"2015-05-17 19:54:04 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Roscoe Bode","content":"I read all of these reviews before deciding on the Grand Wailea for a week with my family, which includes young children. Yes, it is pricey and you should not go if you can't stomach paying $20 for a cocktail, but it was totally worth it for us. The location is amazing, the beach is perfect and close (unlike the Fairmont and Four Seasons) and the pools are heaven for young kids. Nothing else compares to the pool scene here. The Fairmont and Four Seasons are more grown up and elegant in my opinion, but this is not what we wanted with young children. You can tell the resort was built in the early 90s and definitely needs a little updating (the peach paint on the exterior is cheesy), but the grounds are beautiful and huge. Until our children are older, we would not change a thing as they had the time of their lives. The fridge in our room was complimentary by the way. The room was decent and clean but not huge. You could see some wear and tear in the bathrooms, so updating will likely happen in the near future, one would hope. But these were all minor complaints as we had a fabulous holiday here. Our breakfast was included and we loved the buffet at the grand dining room every morning. I had a mediocre massage at the spa, but the baths there were lovely. Highly recommend this hotel to families. If you are a stickler for perfection, go to the Four Seasons, where the scene is little more quiet and grown up. The Grand Wailea was heavenly for us.","date":"2012-05-26 03:08:38 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":3,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Marques Prohaska","content":"We stayed here for 10 days from Jan 15 to Jan 25. It was our first trip to Maui and our purpose was to relax. The hotel is set in beautiful grounds with water features and sculptures everywhere. The lush gardens are constantly being worked on - we thought they were beautifully kept. The hotel's facilities were wide ranging: the extensive pools were fantastic fun for all ages. There was staff located at each rapid, or at the tarzan swing from 10am to 5pm for safety. The rapids and slides are closed outside of these times - but there was plenty of other pool space to enjoy after that. We were able to get sun beds every day at our leisure - there was no annoying reserving of stuff at 6.30 am. The Spa Grande was a lovely experience. We took the special deal $149 which gave an hour's use of the spa baths\/saunas etc before a 50min massage (included $25 toward a lunch\/dinner at Molokini bistro). I thought this was an enjoyable and indulgent experience - both our masseurs were great. Make sure you get there an hour before your massage to use the different baths and saunas etc. The gym was excellent for a hotel - better equipped than some professional gyms! There are some gym classes but some you have to pay an extra $10 eg. spin classes. The yoga classes are complimentary. Give it a go even if you're a beginner. I liked the 7am beach yoga with no-nonsense Nancy. Our room was in the lagoon wing on the 1st floor. Great king size bed, beautiful bathroom - all kept clean. Wifi in room. Everything good quality and worked. Amazing sunsets. Breakfast in the Grand Dining room - a huge buffet with American\/European\/Hawaiian\/Japanese dishes and an egg station. During our 10-day stay we were always able to choose something we liked from the buffet. Staff was quick to refill, in our experience. Egg guy was great. We found the staff at Grand Wailea to be friendly and non-intrusive (which is how we like it). I suppose I could go on - but the review is already a bit rambling. On the whole we had an amazing stay - something for everyone. The one annoyance was the $25 daily resort fee. You know of course before you book. I liked the fact that you didn't have to go with the valet parking at $20 a day but you could self-park and this was included in the $25 fee. They have now changed this arrangement and you have to take the valet parking at $20 p\/day and the resort fee has been reduced to $20 p\/day. Just take this in to account when you are looking at the daily cost of staying at this hotel.","date":"2013-12-05 16:01:19 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":4,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Lelah Krajcik","content":"Rooms: We got a basic garden view room, it was the least expensive, but did not seem cheep in any way. I asked about an upgrade and was told they were at 100% occupancy with none available. We were in the Chapel wing on the first floor and I must say the room was amazing. I was very impressed. The bed was very comfortable, the room, bathroom, patio, were huge, and very well appointed. Beautiful bathrooms, beautiful furniture, and we even had a waterfall near our door in one of the many amazing gardens. Humuâ€™s: I got a Mai Tai, which normally I am not a fan of when they give them out at most Hawaiian hotels, but this was highly recommended by some other guests; letâ€™s just say I am a fan of Humuâ€™s Mai Tais. Wow! The service was impeccable, attentive, and knowledgeable. The food was all good. I recommend the Ahi Traps. Resort food tends to be expensive, thought the GWâ€™s food wasnâ€™t outrageously expensive, it was actually less than I expected. (Please donâ€™t use this as a cue to raise your prices). Pools: For being at 100% occupancy, the hotel sure did not feel crowded. They really did a great job of laying things out, having a variety of pools, etc. Donâ€™t get me wrong, it was pretty crowded, but it still felt personable, lots of small pool areas, etc. Most of the chairs were taken if we didnâ€™t rush out at 6am, but we eventually found two chairs together both days. Also, be sure you go to the activities desk and get a wrist band each day. We didnâ€™t know this our first day, and security will ask you to leave if you donâ€™t have one. I guess people try to sneak in from the Four Seasons or the Marriott? There were a lot of children, though Hawaii is a family destination, so we expected this. Most were very well behaved, supervised by parents, etc. But I feel I need to warn others who are looking for more of an adult only retreat, thought they did have an adult only pool, but that was more crowded than others. The pools are fun. They have a network of waterslides connecting the pools and even have a water elevator if you donâ€™t want to climb the stairs. I donâ€™t think I have been to a water park type place in over 20 years; letâ€™s just say I had a lot of fun. Many other adults were partaking in the waterslides too. Pool\/Food\/Bars: We have stayed in a lot of resort type places over the past few years, and the GW is defiantly in the top two to three. The staff is so nice and helpful, very personable. The drinks by the pool are reasonably priced for a resort of this caliber, and they do not skimp on the alcohol. The food was amazing, even with pool side service. The pool side service is slow, but the wait staff always told us what the expected time would be, as they prepare all of the food fresh. They also have a grotto bar that you swim up too. Itâ€™s inside a cave with flowers growing out of the walls, amazing! Though the music gets loud later in the day, but they have tables outside the bar as well, also in the water. We had such a great time at the GW and canâ€™t wait to go back. It was an amazing experience, beautiful grounds which we walked for hours, amazing hospitality, and everything was just designed really well. There is shopping on site, and an outdoor mall within walking distance. They have activities on site, though we didnâ€™t participate in much on this stay. We did go to the marine station and learn about whales. But we were more into relaxing and hanging by the pool and walking on the beach.","date":"2014-06-23 12:01:55 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":3}},{"author":"Stanton Hayes","content":"We were looking for a luxurious getaway and planned a few nights at the Grand Wailea before heading off to Kauai.

The conference rate was substantially below the rack rates for the rooms. Grounds are fantastic- one of the nicest hotels I've ever been to, and I have traveled a fair amount. Truly impressive- especially the pools, which may be some of the nicest in the world. They have a lei greeting and an impressive entrance. I was a little disappointed when we checked in, because the person at the front desk gave me a hard time about the room type. I brought my wife with me and the room type was a big deal for us- this was both a late anniversary celibration and her birthday was the final day of our trip. We wanted it to be special. I used to have a fairly decent Hilton Hhonors level status, but we have two young kids and I lost it since I haven't traveled as much since they were born. I mention this because as with any other hotel, your status matters in how they treat you. Since our conference rate was the same price for a variety of room types, this issue probably wouldn't apply to those who pay a set price for a specific room type. I booked way ahead to reserve a 'deluxe oceanfront' room. A colleague with higher Hhonors status who booked when only garden view rooms were available requested an oceanfront room (right next to me in line) and they gave it to him without hassle. The person at the counter gave me a garden room and then told me three times that room types are not guaranteed. I was getting ready to ask for a manager when she finally (reluctantly) agreed to give me the room type I booked. I would understand if she said it once to make the point, but I just traveled 15 hours from the east coast to get there, and I expect that if the hotel can simply accomodate the request I made, that they do so without hassling me. Although the start was rocky, the rest of the stay improved. Again, the grounds are fantastic. Amazing. The room itself was nice, but not commensurate with the price of the hotel. I would have been a little disappointed if we paid full price. As many other reviews state, you are paying for the grounds. They're worth it. Our view was not as good as a couple of other oceanfront rooms on site that my colleagues got, but I did have an ocean view and that was good enough. Our room had a shower and large (non-jetted) tub and a balcony with a table and chairs. The pictures on the website seem to be fairly accurate- this is not always the case with some hotels, but what you see is what you get here. This room would have been expected in a standard hilton beach property, but not in a waldorf astoria. It is due for a remodel in the rooms. I had emailed in advance about a fridge for the room because food is EXPENSIVE on and near the property. Get a rental car, because a cab is about $60 each way to\/from the airport and there is great food fairly reasonably priced in Kihei about 5 miles down the road. Parking was a little annoying- the parking garage is a quarter mile down the road if you don't want to pay for the valet. The on-site eating options are good, but quite expensive. We had dinner at humuhumunukunukuapuaa and it was very nice. My wife had lobster and steak, and I had sushi and fresh fish ceviche. Both were nicely prepared. They told me the fridge would be $25 for the whole stay. When I checked in, they said $5 delivery charge plus $8 a day. Then when we checked out after five nights, there was an almost $80 charge (no idea where they got this figure)! The front desk happily adjusted it to $25 when I showed the email that I got from the hotel representative. The worst part- the fridge was already in the room the whole time!!! All they did was come in and use a key to unlock the cabinet where it was stored. On the second day of our stay, we noticed that the fridge had frozen our items. The milk was a hard slush, beers were nearly frozen, everything else was inedible because it was too cold. Tried turning down the thermostat, that only made it worse. Everything froze hard, so we couldn't use the milk for our coffee and I was afraid the glass beer bottles would explode if I took them out by hand. I mentioned the problem to the front desk and they volunteered to get us a new fridge and replace all the food items right away. They replaced the beer, milk, and cream. We also had bought guacamole dip and french onion dip at the grocery store. They replaced them with fresh guacamole and had the chef whip us up some french onion dip using Maui sweet onions. I mention the fridge incident not because I hold it against the hotel that the first fridge broke, but because it shows that they do take the effort to try and fix problems when they occur. Although we had a rough day without our coffee, the effort the hotel made to fix it made up for the problem. The dips were delicious! When not at the conference, we did the typical tourist stuff (road to hana, sunrise at the volcano, etc.). But I spent the most (non-work) time at the pool. The slides and lazy river are great! Spent some time (and a few bucks) at the grotto bar. If you pay a little extra, you can get a big pineapple mug that holds a lot more than the other cups and you get a whole lot more drink for you money the rest of your trip. I didn't figure this out until too late. Speaking of drink deals, there was a (unadvertised, as far as I could tell) happy hour in the main bar in the middle of the hotel from 5-6 with a serious discount on mai tais. The beach in front of the hotel is pristine. Swimming there is comfortable and safe. We booked a snorkeling trip to two sites- Molokini crater and turtle town. Drove a half hour north of the hotel to get to the boat (boss frogs, which was inexpensive and great), and they went to molokini first. Then, turtle town ended up being directly in front of the hotel!!! If you have (or rent) snorkel gear, you can easily check out the turtles on the southern end of the beach in front of the hotel. You can swim or kayak out just a little bit and see the turtles surfacing. Some were almost as big as a vw beetle. My wife visited the spa on her birthday and loved it. The locals had told us (when we mentioned where we were staying) that our hotel had the best spa on the island. My wife didn't try any others, but certainly enjoyed this one very much. In summary, the grounds were amazing, the room was nice (if not quite up to our expectations), and expect to pay extra for everything. The location in Wailea is great.

We were staying on points and free night vouchers. The Grand Wailea is on a nice beach. In Sept. it never seemed crowded at the beach or pools. I really thought the pools and beach were nicer than other Wailea properties nearby. The property, common areas, spa, were all very nice. The grounds were lovely and while we were there it was obvious that a lot of care and attention goes into keeping it that way. Lucky I read another review where the couple found a coupon in the in room magazine for the spa....around $150 for an hour in the baths (which there are several, shower of different kinds, sauna), a 50 min. massage, and lunch at Bistro Molokini. With tip, tax, and a t-shirt with the spa logo it came to around $200. Without the coupon it would have started at around $200. I really did enjoy the baths, massage and lunch. My spouse couldn't justify the expense so to each his or her own. Our room was very comfortable and the view was gorgeous. It was quite a hike to the self park from our room on the other side of the resort, but that was fine. Other than Bistro Molokini, which is a bar and cafe out by the pools, we ate on property at the cafe located in the shops at Grand Wailea for lunch ( note is has strange hours and not open every day). We rented a refrigerator for $7 a day, which saved us quite a bit on breakfasts. We found provisions at the natural foods grocery, Mana Foods in Paia. I liked that little town. Has some nice shopping and restaurants like the Paia Fish Market (casual cafe on the corner...Ono burger was great) and good art galleries. Drove the road to Hana, went north to Lahaina, and up Haleakala Mountain (about a 10K elevation gain and great views).

I know its not exactly fair to compare a different hotel chain from a different island, but we paid similar money to stay at both, with similarly nice accomodations. St Regis Kauai is head and shoulders above in terms of service, grounds upkeep, and exclusivity. You can relax there, not worry about racing for good seats, there are not 1000's of screaming children and pushy adults. I just dont know how else to describe it other than \"down market,\" which is not how a hotel in this price range should feel, in my opinion. The good: Our room was awesome, we were on the 5th or 6th floor and we were upgraded to oceanview room with terrace. Room was perfectly nice, although our couch was a bit stodgy. Otherwise an A+. Room service despite not serving 24hrs (which lets be real people at these prices and on maui, this should be available) was pretty good and we used them several times. Great views from the room. The beach was nice (if you could get on it). The pools\/slides are cool. The grounds are very nice in certain areas where the original hotels grandeur has been preserved, such as the lobbys and entrance and some of the outer grounds\/gardens. Its beautiful to walk around at night. There is a nice long path that runs along the hotel beach and goes past many other hotels, nice for a walk in the morning or sunset. Good snorkeling can be found near by, we swam with sea turtles and saw lots of fish. And the highlight of our trip was SHANE THE BARTENDER, WHO ROCKED . HE KNEW US BY NAME AND WELCOMED US WARMLY each time we popped by for a drink. He would remeber what we drank last and was very good. Unfortunately, he was the only one who we got this type of service from at this hotel (and in comparison, when at the st regis, there were several employees throughout the resort who knew us by name and were outgoing and friendly.) Big difference to me. The Bad: I was here 10 yrs ago, and let me tell you there has been alot of change. All these glowing reviews of this place must be from first time travelers to this hotel. If they had the priviledge to see this place in its glory, they would have a better idea of whats gone wrong with this place. The hotel itself is basically the same, except everything seems worn and dirty: pathways are dirty and falling apart in some areas, there are wood banisters in some spots that need some up keep or paint or to be redone, or something. The grandiose gardens that I came back for are not as well kept, and there are plants that are really beat up and half dying. They need to be replaced. The grass along the walkways is worn out and its dirt or yellow\/dead in many places. they try to cut and paste new grass is but it just doesnt look right. The water by the restaurant on the tropical lagoon is atrocious looking, I was concerned for the fish they had in it (and in the grand scheme of things these might not be such a big deal, and I am being critical, but only because I saw the real Grand Wailea Hotel and Spa, and know how far its fallen. Several times we tried to call down to the concierge and the phone just rand and rang and rang. I spoke to several peope who are \"members\" allowing them special rates and frequent visits and they agreed that the place has taken a turn for the worse.) There is just a major vibe of corner cutting, and just maintaing what they have, to milk it for as much money as they possibly can, without investing anything more money into it. OK NOW LETS TALK ABOUT THE UNPLEASANT POOL\/BEACH SCENE. I love the pools at this place. However, there are just too many people on this property. WHERE DO ALL THESE PEOPLE COME FROM?!!?!?!?!?!? The management is dropping the ball here big time. Finding a free chair can be a nightmare. There are lines for towels, which are needed to claim a chair. People line up at ungodly hours to be first. They say they clear the towels off the chairs if people dont come down after an hour, but I didnt see this happen once. The pool\/beach staff was not friendly at all. I was told these hotel gigs are hard to get on Maui and are well liked by the locals, apparently not! The loungers and chairs around the pools are stacked so closely there may not even be an inch between them, and in some places they go 3 or 4 rows deep. I felt like I was sitting on the expressway, in rush hour, only in a lounge chair with palm trees around me, and a melted 20 odd dollar pinacolada. And dont let them tell you they are at max capacity, because this hotel is huge and was not filled if we were getting free oceanview room upgrades. The scam here is, they built this huge condo complex (Hoelei? or something)across the street, and to get people to stay there, they allow them full access to the Grand Wailea pools and grounds. These people seem to bring kids by the dozen. Its screaming kids all day. I felt like I was at a six flags water park, not an alleged 4 star resort upscale resort. So you basically have 2 resorts worth of people on one property. NO WONDER THE PLACE IS SO OVER CROWDED. SO HERE I AM WITH MY VERY HIGH ROOM RATE AND 20$ COCKTAIL, STRUGGLING TO FIND A SEAT ANYWHERE NEAR A BODY OF WATER, WEDGED IN TRAFFIC 3 ROWS BACK FROM THE POOL AND IM STUCK BEHIND\/PUSHED OUT BY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT EVEN HOTEL GUESTS!!!!!!!! THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!!!!!!! but this is not a problem, just simply rent one of there 300 dollar a day poolside huts and you will not have to worry. Service is so so poolside. Did I mention the screaming kids yet? haha! This place has sold its soul in my opinion, I dont even want to get into the beach scene, which was actually a little better. I left with a bad taste in my mouth, wishing I had never left the st regis. I will never be back. I gave 3 stars because the grounds are still somewhat nice in comparison to most properties and the pools are still cool. If you walked around this place at night after all the cattle go back to the barn, and the darkness covers up the blemishes, its a beautiful place. We just spent alot of time off the property and hung in our room so we could have some peace and quiet. Something that there is a severe shortage of here. Do yourself a favor and go to the 4 Seasons, the Ritz or Kea lani if your coming to Maui. We were watering at the mouth walking past the Marriot Outrigger resort which is down the beach path from the GW. Things looked so peaceful and realxing and serent there. Chairs were spaced out appropriately. This place needs to lower its prices and have there 4 star rating removed. We still managed to have a great time here, but beware! Things are not the same here anymore. If we do come back we'll stay at the Marriott a few doors down or the Ritz in Kaplua or 4 seasons next door. Both looked serene and could be had for less money, except the 4 seasons. BOTTOM LINE: THE GRAND WAILEA IS A ZOO AND THE HOTEL HAS TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE!!!! IF YOU MUST GO, IT BETTER BE DURING THE SLOWEST PART OF THE SEASON THERE. LOOK ELSEWHERE, UNLESS YOU ARE A FAMILY WITH & KIDS AND PLAN TO STAY AT THE CONDO PLACE HOELEI ACROSS THE STREET. GOOD LUCK!","date":"2014-03-22 19:04:55 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":5,"Overall":3,"Rooms":4,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":1}},{"author":"Baron Graham","content":"The Front Desk: When we first arrived at the Grand Wailea, we had 2 separate rooms, so we had two different desk clerks. One of them was NOT nice!! I think some previous reviewers mentioned the lack of courtesy before. When you are spending almost $400+ per night for a BASIC room, EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE SMILING AND KIND!!! Not the case. The clerk did her job, but was not pleasant and never once even cracked a smile. The other clerk was very nice and accommodating and he ended up upgrading our room to an ocean view. Several other desk clerks were also very friendly, but I feel like at this level of hotel, there should be absolutely no exceptions. The Rooms: They were very spacious and pretty nice. We had a room with double queen beds. The bathroom was huge, mostly marble, and the toilet was separate from the rest of the bathroom and had a separate door, which I really liked. There was a large soaking tub and a separate shower with a little bench. Good water pressure and plenty of space for your things. Great little mango\/honey shower gels and shampoo\/conditioners. Usually, I ignore the hotel samples, but these were very nice. There was a large flat screen TV in the room and plantation shutters that kept out most of the light if you wanted to sleep in. You could also sleep with the windows open and the screen door closed, so no bugs got in. Maid service was annoying, but efficient. They just came way too early, so we had to use the do not disturb sign every day. The carpets did look like they could stand to be replaced. They weren't dirty, but again, for the price of the rooms, we expected better. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows were great. I slept well every night. The hotel: The hotel is extremely ornate and has a lot of beautiful elements. Statues all over the place, flowers all over the place, they've clearly put a LOT of money into making this hotel spectacular. That being said, we went down the street to the Four Seasons to have a drink and it was sheer understated elegance. We didn't go into any of the guest rooms, but the common areas were just gorgeous and classy. While the GW is not OVERstated, we agreed that it IS stated. If we were to spend that type of money again, we would probably go to the Four Seasons. In addition, the GW property is HUGE. There is a long walk pretty much anywhere you go. I think we were pretty central to everything, but it took at least 3-5 minutes to walk anywhere. I would have hated to have had one of the less central rooms. It was mostly ok because the weather was pleasant, but at times it was just a pain in the butt. There were times when I would bring things for later just so I didn't have to walk to get back to the room. The pools: There are a ton of pools on the property, but we only used the adult pool, which was nice. There were a lot of slides all over, which would be a lot of fun for kids, but we weren't sure if there was an age or height limit and it didn't appear that they were used too much by adults, so we never used them. Never too crowded (we went the week after the Labor Day holiday) and the pool had a beautiful fountain. You could get as many towels as you liked, but they did ask for your name and room number before giving you anything. It wasn't a long process. The beach: The beach behind the pools is GORGEOUS. We had the use of free beach chairs and umbrellas while at the beach and the sand out there was just supersoft and beautiful. It's a golden color, so it's darker than what I normally see, but I got used to it very quickly. There was very little debris in the sand or the water and it made swimming in the ocean a joy. I would walk down the beach next door to the front of the Four Seasons property and enjoy the view from there. Just stunning. The spa: Spa Grande is FABULOUS!!! The facilities are great and I didn't have enough time to fully enjoy them to the extent I wanted. Think Burke Williams within a resort. There are 5 different baths with different salts, eastern and western hot and cold pools, a steam room, sauna and several other amenities. Make sure you ask for a tour of the facility so you know where everything is. And get there at least an hour before your service so you can enjoy it. If I did it again, I'd allow myself an hour and a half to two hours because I like to do repeats. They also give you a free 5 minute exfoliation if you are receiving a service. This is a great way to ensure that all of the guests are clean before they use the amenities (you are still required to shower first). I got an 80 minute massage that wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was perfectly fine and I felt extremely relaxed afterward. One thing that was REALLY annoying about the spa is that the staff was constantly walking around calling names of guests who had services scheduled. When you are trying to relax in the steam room or a bath or something, the last thing you want to hear is someone else's name repeated over and over (rather loudly, I might add). They should take a hint from Burke Williams and require folks to report to one area 5 minutes prior to their service. That way, the other guests are not disturbed. They came to get me a full 10 minutes prior to my service. I needed my 10 minutes and still made it upstairs in enough time that I had to wait for my masseuse. The food: It's extremely expensive. Extremely. We had lunch once at the restaurant closest to the Hibiscus Pool (I forget the name) and the food was very average. Definitely not worthy the price. We had dinner one night at Humuhumunukunukuapua'a (named after the fish) and it was pretty good, but again, very pricey. We were having a birthday celebration and had asked for seating to see the sunset, but we didn't feel like the seating we got was optimal. In fact, when we spoke to the person making the reservation, she told us the sun set at 7:30pm when it was fully below the horizon at 6:30!! A couple of the servers were great, though, and we had fun with them. We mostly ate off property, including The Shops down the street. We really enjoyed Longhi's for breakfast and we also ate at the place next door to it (something about burgers), but didn't enjoy the food or the service nearly as much as Longhi's. One day, my friend and her dad had the $50 buffet brunch, which they said was decent. They did mention that the view from the buffet was spectacular. I went driving up a mountain instead, so I missed it. :) We also had dinner at Nick's Fishmarket, which had delicious food and stellar service and we tried Pacifico's in Lahaina (worth the 45 minute drive -- if you go, be sure to get some shaved iced from Ululani's). Our first night, we ate at Cafe Olei (sp?), which we didn't particularly enjoy. The expensive food was average to below, with a less than average atmosphere at a strip mall. It was recommended to us by the valets at the hotel. Bad choice, skip it. The concierge service: On one day, I spent over 3 hours going back and forth with the concierge about activity plans. It was my most frustrating, non-enjoyable day. I wanted to go to Road to Hana, but the people I was with didn't want to go, so the concierge (who sounded like she knew her stuff) told me there were less touristy, more spiritual things to do there. We agreed to connect an hour later and when I showed up, she was the only concierge out of 4 of them who was busy. After waiting for 30 minutes and seeing the people going nowhere, I finally asked her to call me when they were done because I wanted to get in some time in the sun. Of course, she called as soon as I settled in my lounge chair. She said I needed to come back up so she could show me some places on a map, so I headed back up. The call soon dropped and she didn't call back. When I called back, I was told she was busy with other guests. I walked up soon after and she started apologizing profusely for having to leave!!! I couldn't believe she had taken an hour break, then came back, helped other people and left without helping me!! She passed me off to another concierge who gave me incorrect directions, even though I asked her repeatedly whether she knew where she was going and told her I didn't want to drive for 45 minutes to get lost. She seemed very unsure of herself. I had to ask her a thousand questions over the course of about an hour just to get any relevant information. And guess what? I never found the location. She claimed she would send up a more detailed map, but the map she sent up was less detailed than the one she showed me at the desk!! Completely useless!! And none of them seemed to know about the black sand beach 10 minutes down the road!! I just don't get how these people can hold these jobs and know practically nothing about what's going on and where things are ... I definitely expected more from such a highly rated hotel, but I was completely disappointed.... Overall, though I enjoyed my visit, I wouldn't stay at this resort again ... it's too expensive for what you get and there are plenty of other really nice places to stay in the area.... but I will DEFINITELY be back to Maui ... it's awesome!!!","date":"2014-10-10 19:04:09 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":4,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":3,"Sleep Quality":4,"Value":2}},{"author":"Abdullah Weber MD","content":"So beautiful, best weather and best beach.

Last time I was in Wailea a few yrs ago I stayed at the FS, so I am somewhat jaded. This hotel is enormous....almost 800 rooms! Everything seemed like a hike. Was a 5-10 min walk from my room just to get to the pool. Felt I was nickel and dimed at check in. $25 resort fee. $10 luggage transfer fee. $3 maid gratuity fee. All this on top of my nightly rate. Didn't find staff to be too polite or accomodating. They need some lessons from their neighbors down the beach (FS & Fairmount). Anytime I asked a question, they made me feel like I was harassing them. Would not stay here again and would not recommend to anyone...even families....there are plenty of other resorts in HI that'll cater to children. You don't need to spend your money at this place. The biggest joke was the line of people (40 deep) waiting to get towels prior to the pool opening at 7 AM. It stressed me out just looking at them from my beachside yoga class. This is not a 5 star property, or anything close to luxurious.

I think the glory days for the GW are long gone. It's still on a beautiful beach and the pool is nice if you don't mind 5000 screaming kids like Disneyworld. During our visit there must have been some sort of Fred Durst family convention going on LOL I swear, every guy there had a backwards baseball cap, a goatee or soul patch (!) and had tons of kids in tow. The whole grounds, pool area and all the patios (especially on the ground floor) looked like they had been hit with a tidal wave of inflatable toys, boogie boards, towels, food, soda bottles and trash. I have nothing against kids, but this place markets itself as a romantic high-end luxury property (with prices to match) but in reality it is more like a huge 3 1\/2 star Disney hotel aging in a beautiful location. Did I mention most of the Durst clones were sloppy drunk at the pool by 1PM? A true Durster wouldn't even get up until 1PM. Amateurs ;) They should lower their prices and lower their guests expectations. The prices at GW are still very high and there are many other beachfront hotels that are less expensive and will probably offer the same experience for less $. If you are looking to spend big bucks for a romantic luxury trip of a lifetime and you want a true 5 star experience, you will be much happier at the Four Seasons next door or the Ritz in Kapalua.

I have worked in the hospitality industry over the past 30 years and currently own and operate a Destination Management Company in Scottsdale Arizona. Service is the key to my success and anytime I travel, I am always evaluating those who I encounter. I recently took a family vacation to Grand Wailea Resort on the island of Maui. I can not express enough what a wonderful time we had. The room was spacious and had all the necessary amenities to enhance our stay. My kids, 10 & 12 are still talking about the Tarzan Swing, Water Slides and Water Elevator. My wife on the other hand enjoyed a message by the adult pool. During one of the evenings, I noticed that a group was having a private Luau on the beach. What a spectacular setting, over looking the ocean with the sun setting. Even though Arizona is known for it sunsets, there is no comparison to what I experienced in Maui! The service at the hotel was outstanding, from the pool service to the front desk. As I had mentioned, being in the industry, sometimes I can be a little demanding. Not once did anyone say no or even give me a reason to think twice. Upon check-out, we needed to vacate our room due to a large group checking in. Since our plane did not depart until 10:30PM, the front desk clerk suggested that we enjoy the pool facilities and than come back to the desk and they would give us a hospitality room to change. In closing, I would highly recommend the Grand Wailea Resort to anyone who is looking for a beautiful hotel, with impeccable service, unbelievable sunsets and wonderful recreational activities, than this is the hotel for you!

When we got to the beach we saw a line resembling the running of the brides at Filene's Basement in Boston (except it was coed). We were puzzled and asked what everyone was lining up for. The response was that everyone was there to claim their chairs! I told my husband that I REFUSED to enter that rat race and line up at 6:30 to get a chair. Well, that was a mistake as I ended up laying on my towel on the beach at a $700 a night resort! I felt like I was back in HS! The elderly couple next to me was in the same predicament and I watched in horror as the gentlemen struggled to get up from the sand. The pool area resembled a scene from CNN showing the tent cities in Haiti. People were elbow to elbow with towels, rafts, etc strewn about.

It really is a beautiful hotel on a beautiful stretch of beach. Room We had a few problems with our room during our stay - the toilet broke, the safe broke, and the TV broke...seems like alot of problems for a room during a 7 day stay. I will say, however, that they very promptly responded to the concerns and fixed the toilet and safe very promptly...although the safe malfunctioned again at the end of our stay, we didn't bother to raise the issue again. The TV never was fixed properly - every 15 min, we had to jiggle the coaxial wire when the TV signal was lost; this after 2 service calls. however, we didn't spend much time watching TV so it wasn't a big deal. In my opinion for a hotel of this class (and price), I think it is ridiculous to have 3 issues with a room during a single week. The bed was great - very comfortable, and the lanai was equally great. Bathroom was definitely 5-star. Beach Note, this resort is situated on a public beach. Not a swimming beach, at least at the time of the year we were there, but wonderful soft sand, and fun to jump into the waves...good for kids and adults. We rented a \"casabella\" for 4 of the days we were there and what a WASTE of money. True, you do get a guaranteed spot, and a nice view of the ocean, but of significant issue was the fact that about 2:30pm, we had non-paying \"visitors\" squatting in the adjacent casabellas. I raised this with the staff, and they explained that because they start removing the loungers and umbrellas at 3pm, this is a \"grey\" area and they don't really enforce the use of the casabellas for that reason from about 3pm onward. Well, there didn't seem to be any \"grey area\" with my $50\/day bill for use of the casabellas! I think the resort should be pro-rating the charge for the \"free\" hours they are allowing non-paying patrons to use them. It really is absurd - so my advice, do not book a casabella...instead, wait until about 2:30pm and choose any free one and enjoy! Clearly the hotel has no problem with this. Food The food was excellent. Humu has an amazing filet mignon that is cooked to perfection. All the food was really quite good. Breakfast was quite good too - we ate at the buffet in the Grand Dining Room for breakfast. Like many similar places, you have to be prepared to wait a while to get a made-to-order omlette. The waiters at breakfast could also stand to get a refresher in good customer service...at least some of them. A couple of the waiters we had were great, others were terrible...no service at all. And, I personally saw one of the waiters go to the bathroom (beside the restaurant) and he didn't wash his hands. How disgusting is that? We had room service one evening and it was very good (albeit outrageously priced). Service Service was largely good...not great, but good. The wait staff at dinner was far better than breakfast or lunch. Despite the fact we paid $50\/day for the casabellas, we only had a server approach us on 2 of the 4 days we rented the casabella. I thought the maid service was very good, and was impressed when I went to the room (on two occasions) while the maid was in the room, and she insisted I demonstrate it was my room by using the key card...this vs. my experience in Mexico where I strolled into the room when the maid was there and got a polite smile, despite I could have been anyone taking anything from the room. One other note is the cost of food \/ drinks during the day is really quite absurd. $13 for a cocktail (plus tip?). A hot dog will cost you $12 (each). I ordered some sushi and beers on the beach and rang up a $70 bill for a snack...gimme a break. Overall, a beautiful resort, on a beautiful beach. However, the $50\/day casabella charge when others used it for free really iritated me. I wrote the hotel with the same complaint, and didn't hear back...I guess they don't care. So, my advice to all is feel free to use the casabellas, for free, from 2:30pm onward. And, if anyone asks, this is hotel practice and the \"grey area\". Would I go back? No.","date":"2013-09-17 23:17:25 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":4,"Overall":3,"Rooms":3,"Service":3,"Value":2}},{"author":"Rae Bahringer Sr.","content":"This is a stunningly pretty place to stay.

Our very first impression as we drove in to the resort was that this was going to be a perfect honeymoon. The drive in to the resort is beautiful, especially at night with all of the Tiki torches lit. We were promptly greeted by the valet and escorted to the check-in desk and we were offered a free upgrade, as promised, but we were a bit disappointed that we were only offered a room with 2 double beds instead of a king - especially since the resort appeared to be extremely vacant. The room was as we expected, but it was not perfectly clean. The balconies looked as though they had not been washed in several months and the shower had mold along the grout lines where the grout met the glass. The landscaping of the resort was impeccable, but unfortunately that was not shared by the rest of the amenities. The common area hallways were not very clean and the upkeep was not spectacular. You don't need to look far to see areas that need improvement. Lot's of painting, cleaning, and repairs need to be made to get this hotel to what should be Waldorf-Astoria standards. One day I removed my plastic bracelet (Daily plastic bracelets must be worn to access the pool and beach areas) and placed it on a table near the elevator. Two days later when we checked out it was still there! This should give you some idea of the lack of attention to detail. I would guess that no less than 100 employees walked by that bracelet during those 2 days. The food at the Grand Wailea was spectacular, and overall the service was good. Our highlights include the service at the swim-up pool bar as provided by Wayne and Richard. Our waiter, Justin, at HumuHumu was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Some of the disappointments were the service at the breakfast restaurant, the Grand Dining Room. They must expect most customers to eat the Buffet so that they can serve theirselves, because the service was almost non-existent. We ate here three times and had hrrible service all three times. On our third visit, we decided to time how long it took before we were greeted by our server. It took 12 minutes, followed by another 9 minutes just to get coffee! We did complain to the hotel manager who put us in touch with the Food & Beverage Manager and the charges for two of the meals were reversed. Service by the adult pool was also very poor. We did see servers, but nobody ever stopped by to take our drink orders despite our attempts to wave their attention. We had to go inside the poolside restaurant to get our own drinks. The activities at the GW and in Maui are great. I am a certified diver, but my wife is not. She took a 45 minute course at the resort which consisted of a 20 minute lecture followed by a dive in their own dive pool. We were then both take to a beach dive right at the resort that had some reef and sea life. Our instructor\/guide, Eric, was excellent. He was very friendly and we found sea turtles and a small octopus that we actually held in our hands while he took underwater photography. The concierge was also excellent. You MUST take advantage of the concierge. They will build you a whole itinerary for your visit and have relationships to book all of the non-resort activities on your behalf and have them billed to your room. We took a helicoptor tour of West Maui and Molokini with Sunshine helicoptors. They are the only provider that will guarantee front row seating for two for a small premium upgrade. The tour was good - not great, though that was no fault of the tour guide. It's just unfortunate that there are no active volcanoes to see in Maui. We also took a snorkel\/snuba tour on a powered twin-hull catamaran out of Maalea Harbour. We dove at two locations Molokini Crater and another \"unknown\" location that was know to have lots of turtles. The crater was decent, but if you have any experience scuba diving, then this will not live up to your expectations. We happened to be out on a very windy and wavey day, so the snorkeling was difficult for most of the inexperienced snorkel, snuba divers (Snuba is a hybrid of snorkeling and scuba that allows you to breathe up to 20 feet underwater via a hose and air tank that floats on the surface). The highlight of this tour was having about 20 spinner dolphins swim with the boat as we cruised at slow speed between dives. The burgers that they cook right on board between dives were also pretty tasty! We did a zipline tour in Kaanapali that wes pretty good. Not as scarey as the ziplining in Costa Rica, but that's a good thing for most people. It seems much safer and has very large landing platforms so there is no fear of making any mistakes. In fact, they make it foolproof and the scenery is of course spectacular. The highlight of our activities was the drive to Hana. The drive is simply breathtaking through lush, tropical landscape along the most winding road you will ever travel! I recommend going on a day that has forecasted some rain or had rain the night before. The dozens of waterfalls that we saw along the way were extremely active due to all the rainfall they had up the mountain. Don't worry - it doesn't ever seem to rain in Wailea despite the forecast. Wailea gets 16\" of rain a year while it rains over 350\" just 10 miles away! It's the strangest thing - but very cool! The concierge will provide you a list of the best places to stop along the way to swim in waterholes and waterfalls, eat banana bread, buy local art, have a scenic lunch, etc. Do not miss out on this excursion! It takes a full day, but I found it far more exhilerating than the helicoptor tour. We drove back the same way we came up, though you can go all the way around the mountain. My wife had a videcamera but was afraid to let go of the dashboard because of my speeding down the roads! For driving enthusiasts that like to go fast, this is as good as it gets. By fast I mean a top speed of maybe 30 MPH. This road has over 600 turns where you turn the wheel greater than 45 degrees. I hope Playstation has this road on one of their driving games because I'm buying it! Other recommendations for food include Mama's Fish House for dinner. It's about a 30 minute drive from the resort, but it's very charming and the food is delicious. Everyone that you talk to will tell you to go here. We also had great meals at Duo and Spago next door at the Four Seasons. Overall, we had a wonderful trip. We had some disappointments with the resort that we did not expect to have when spending that kind of money. Plan to spend a lot of money! We averaged about $750 a day for 2 people, not including the cost of the room. The activities will run about $300 for ziplining to over $800 for the helicoptor tour. When you add that to $200+ dinners and lunch and drinks by the pool, you will see how it quickly adds up.","date":"2014-09-12 23:05:11 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":3,"Location":5,"Overall":3,"Rooms":4,"Service":3,"Value":3}},{"author":"Xander Grimes","content":"My husband won a President's Award, which was the only reason we stayed at such an upscale resort.

In particular, Jerry Fournier, the Napua Suite Liaison, has always helped us manage the vacation process before we arrive as well as coordinate plans during our stay. He's a go-to type of person that gets tasks done. Clearly it's a challenge keeping everyone happy simultaneously, but Jerry and his team just find a way to make it happen ! I do spend my fair share of time travelling for business, usually to Asia from the US's east coast multiple times a year. I am quite familiar with good service and few hotels in the US match up to their Asian counterparts. The Napua team is the closest I've seen to that type of service. For me to write something like this is rare indeed. But when someone like Jerry (and I'm sure there are more on the GWR staff) does his job everyday as an unsung hero of the resort, it merits special attention.","date":"2013-11-30 23:50:55 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Irwin O'Connell","content":"We are checking out of the Grand Wailea today and we are really happy to be getting out of here. We've been in Maui for about ten days for our honeymoon and have been staying at a few places including the Ritz Carlton, the Hotel Hana and the Grand Wailea. The Grand Wailea has been a HUGE disappointment. The service is lackluster at best and the entire place is packed with people. There is nothing relaxing about being here- it has the feel of an overpacked cruise ship. The grounds were supposed to be luxurious but are actually pretty tacky. There are ads everywhere for everything from vow renewals to property ownership and the whole place is just a tourist trap nightmare. My husband and I booked a spa treatment at the spa hoping that it would be a nice retreat but it was just more overpriced tourist fodder. The hydrotherapy room was so packed with people that it just seemed gross to be jumping in and out of the pools- you couldn't get any room to yourself. The service at the spa was not good, the whole place is much more hype than reality. At the end of the day we spent over $800 on spa treatments today and if I had to do it over again I wouldn't have done it. Moral of the story- this place is not at all worth it. We had heard that from some of the reviews on TripAdvisor and didn't listen and we couldn't regret it more. We made the mistake of pre-paying for our room and we were so disappointed when we arrived that we tried to cancel and go somewhere else but due to prepaying didn't have the flexibility to do so.

The Good: The facility is beautiful and the beach is beautiful. Everything is well kept and very nice. Room service did a great job every day. We didn't have kids with us so we spent a decent amount of time at the adult pool area. It's a nice pool with a big lawn you can hang out. We really enjoyed the peace and quiet. The beach is open to the public but not too many people outside the resort go there. You can swim in the water and the current is not bad at all. The staff seemed nice and we had good service from just about everyone. Valet parking for the day is free but you pay a lot to stay overnight. The Bad: As with everything in Hawaii the food and beverages at the hotel are very expensive. We bought a styrofoam cooler and some beer and wine at the Wal Mart and kept this in our room. We still ate and drank at the hotel but having our little cooler was a nice break from $10+ drinks. Overnight valet parking is very expensive so we parked in the free lot on the other side of the resort. It's first come first serve and fills up at night so get there early if you want a spot. There are some rooms that are newly renovated and others that are not. We were originally put in a newly renovated room but it had two beds. When they moved us to a room with one bed it was the older room. Bummer. It was nice but not as nice as the other. We didn't pay for our room (paid for by corporate) but when I compared the cost of this hotel vs. other comparable hotels it seemed a little pricey for what you get. I think this is because of the sweet beach location. We would consider returning in spite of this. Especially if we bring kids. The best part of our trip was renting a Harley for the day and cruising the island. Definitely one of the most memorable times of my life. Sorry if my review wasn't very thorough but we spent a lot of time either playing offsite or at organized social functions revolved around business.

The place is basically the \"Grandest\" hotel in probably the grandest resort (Wailea) on probably the best Hawian island. We went at the begining of Sept and it was only a thrid full which was great as busy but just nice, you could always get loungers, always got served quickly etc whereas we spoke to some people who had been there during the main weeks and they said it was bedlam and too busy so avoid then if possble. Hotel itself is huge with some grand rooms - the lobby and main bar area is impressive, with certain areas open to the elements and just oozes class. Rooms very spacious and very comfortable with flat screen tv's, mini bars and all other mod cons - bathroom was loved by my wife as has huge bath and at least a double sized walk in shower, 2 sinks etc etc etc. One of the main reasons we loved it so much was the pool areas; several pools starting at the top of the hill that have different slides (fast, twisty, straight leading into lazy river through ravine) that you just work your way through until you eventually come t the pool bar where \"you have to have a mudslide cocktail\" and then flow through the lazy river that takes you metres from the beachfront and then if you see fit back up to the top on a water elevator. For adults and bigger kids only who want fast slides, there are 2 big slides that go from top to bottom quickly that are great fun. Food at the hotel and neigbouring hotels (Fairmont & Four Seasons) plus \"The shops at Wailea\" is out of this world, good sized portions and sea food to die for (I think i ate the Pacifics stock of Scallops and Shrimp). The only downside is that this holiday aint a cheap one. The Grand Wailea dont seem to discount and only offer room only and the local restaurants as mentioned above costs best part of $200 per meal (2 adults and one child, starter, main and couple drinks) but i guess you get what you pay for. 10 mins drive away are cheaper restaurants and good supermarkets that you should definately use to stock up your water, drinks, snacks etc as they are probably only 25% of the price you pay at the hotel. Would i go there again - most definately and to be honest would kind of live with the cost if it was not for the 10 hour flight to the West Coast of America followed by a further 6 hours to Maui.

The room overlooked the small chapel at the hotel where weddings take place. It is surrounded by a pond with giant fish that my kids loved to feed. We could also see some of the ocean. The gardens of the hotel are the highlight as they obviously spared no expense in landscaping the grounds. The hotel is a masterpiece. The open air lobby is magnificent and the fitness center is the nicest I have ever seen in a hotel. The problem is you pay a heavy price to stay here and I am not sure it is worth it. We booked our room through an opthalmology meeting that was there in order to get a meeting rate. We still paid 400 dollars a night, plus multiple fees were added on including an 18 dollar a day \"resort fee\" supposedly to cover our access to the swimming pools and fitness center. The food and drink prices are prohibitively expensive. They charged my children 8 dollars each for a frozen lemonade at the pool restaurant. A minimal lunch for 3 was over 70 dollars (at the pool). We ended up eating every meal at restaurants in Kihei. They even charged us 25 dollars to rent a small fridge for the week as the rooms have a fridge, but it is full of high priced snacks and drinks and is locked unless you opt for the \"self service bar\" option. The rooms were nice, but not exceptional for the price. The swimming pools were so cold that it was unpleasant to swim in them. There were no organized pool activities and no drink service at the pools. The beach was great and well maintained. The staff was pleasant but not overly friendly. The nicest person I met there was the maid for our room. They did respond quickly when or toilet clogged. The whole place had an air of pretentiousness about it. I think the only people who can afford it are foreigners who's currency is strong against the dollar. I struggled daily to find a parking place big enough for my rented minivan in the under sized self park garage that was quite a hike to my room. The garage by the front of the hotel is valet parking only. When I return to Maui I will stay somewhere more reasonable as the main attraction to the Grand Wailea is the many pools and its location.

This year my conference had it's meetings at the hotel. Usually I have always stayed at the now defunct Renaissance Hotel 2 hotels north. For all the hype I've heard and the prices, I was expecting to be wowed. Unfortunately I was underwowed. I am a Diamond member within the Hilton Hotel system and the front desk notified me that I was upgraded to a deluxe ocean view for which I am grateful. When I asked where self parking was, they told me \"a quarter mile down the road\". This wasn't as bad as it sounded as you can walk most of it through the hotel. The bad part is there is very little parking and the spaces are sized for Mini Coopers. I was glad I turned down the upgrade to a Cadillac as I would never have parked. Vallet parking is $20\/night. I arrived to my room on the 7th floor of the Wailea wing at the distal third of the wing. Nice view of the ocean and quiet until last night when a noisy family arrived above me at midnight. The room was spacious and has a nice marble bathroom and tub. 2 robes are provided, but no slippers. I've never been to a Hilton here in the states or around the world that didn't have slippers. When I called housekeeping they said slippers \"were only for VIPs\", but they brought me some anyway. Being a diamond member (which is the highest level of Hilton's frequent guest program) apparently didn't count. The Waldorf-Astoria collection is part of the Hilton Family. The coffee in the room and at the Grand Dining room is truly awful. The second worst coffee I've ever had after a Holiday Inn in Souzhou, China. My next problem was the internet connection. I spent about 3 hours with Lodgenet (the hotel's internet support in Atlanta, GA) and 2 of the engineering employees here at the hotel. Finally, we took my computer to the next room that worked perfectly and the engineer took that modem and placed it in my room and I finally had service. The engineer here at the hotel didn't seem to understand computers very well, and the support staff at Lodgenet couldn't figure out the issue. The breakfast buffet came with my room and the setting is beautiful overlooking the grounds and ocean. A egg bar is there for personalized eggs of any sort. There is a Japanese bar with miso soup, rice and condiments. Hot foods with sablefish alternating without another fish which are both overcooked and dry. Sliced potatoes alternating with hash browns, Bacon, and a meat hash. There is also waffles, fruit selections, salad ingredients and some really good smoked salmon daily. Breads are massed produced and taste like it. The buffet is $28\/person.The day I arrived the major pools were shut down for renovation and only the Hibiscus Pool is currently open. There are 2 jacuzzis with this open until 10PM. The beach is one of the best on Maui. Unfortunately, being at the front of the property from the pool down to the beach is also the area that you can hear the generators for the workers. They are there everyday during all daylight hours. If you want to enjoy the beach and not hear construction noise you can walk to the Fairmont further south (the Four Seasons next store shares the same beach and has the same noise pollution). Otherwise, you can go north to the beach that was in front of the Renaissance. This is pretty deserted because the hotel is now closed. The staff is friendly and the housekeeping staff is cleaning my rooms well. As the previous reviewer noted, I also haven't received bar soap since my last one was used. The scented Mango\/coconut lotion\/shampoo etc smells good, but the shampoo made my hair feel \"rough\" and not clean. Overall, I am enjoying my stay after getting around all the hiccups, but to me the physical plant is similar to what the Renaissance was, not anything better. I checked out the Marriott next store and was disappointed. They had sold the Renaissance and moved here, but the rooms, amenities, quality is not at the level the Renaissance was. The Grand Spa they say is rated the best spa in the US by Conde Nast. Once again I was expecting to be wowed, and wasn't. It is very similar to the California Burke William Spas, but more expensive of course. The terme room is a nice concept, but when you think about 5 or 6 bathtubs with different solutions (like mud, seaweed etc) into which multiple people get in and out of after soaking for any length of time, it's like sharing your bathtub at home with multiple people you don't know.","date":"2015-10-06 11:04:54 +0300","ratings":{"Overall":4}},{"author":"Ambrose Hahn","content":"The exterior or the grounds of Grand Wailea is beautiful! The moment you drive up you feel that you have arrived in paradise as you watch their mini waterfall. The hotel has all the amenities you need, just a walk to the pools, beach, nearby hotel restaurants, spa, & water activities. With all these positives the negative would be the price and the room. I think the price you pay should be relative to what you get. The hotel is overrated. It seems like they put all the money, near $500 a night they charge the customers with the upkeep of the exterior of the hotel and fell short with the actual rooms. We were assigned a room that was a bit of a walk to the beach and pool area. Our room's view was facing the self parking. If you are a very light sleeper like I am, try not to get a room assigned on this side. In the morning you can kind of hear the trucks making their deliveries around 6am! The room itself, looks outdated. It is not terrible, its just descent. We expected more for the price. The hotel should put the money renovating their rooms. In regards to food, the only time we ate at the hotel was for breakfast from the cafe. The food lacked flavor. I ordered a waffle and my husband ordered a breakfast platter. It consists of eggs, sausage, bread roll, and a cup of rice. We didn't even order any drinks and we paid about $38. Again, the price is definitely NOT relative to the overall stay. My suggestion is to book a room at a nearby hotel and walk over to Grand Wailea to take pictures.","date":"2014-05-24 04:36:52 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4,"Check in \/ front desk":3,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":2,"Overall":3,"Rooms":3,"Service":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Oswald Gleichner","content":"Some of the reviews would make you think there are two different parts of the hotel...while we haven;t stayed in every resort in Hawaii, this is the best so far out of 4 resorts at different islands...the place was immaculate, room was very clean, no signs of wear and large enough for 2 adults with 2 adult teenagers.

On this trip it was only my wife and I. Next time i will bring my two children. I have never stayed in a resort as completely overwhelming in class as The Grand. Do know that it would be really tough to stay here on a budget. Everything, especially the food, is pricey. We checked in on Sunday, July 20th, and took advantage of the Sunday Brunch. It was $48 per person. It was amazing. The next day we ate Sushi at Kincha's. Two buffets and an additional Rainbow Roll, plus a tea and glass of wine and we walked out the door for $160. The sushi, even for a buffet, was as good as I have ever had. For lunch another day we ate at the pool and for two wraps, two bottle waters, one smoothie, a mixed drink, plus tip and we signed a ticket for $70. In case you are wondering, all of the food and drinks are tops, but you get what you pay for. The view from my 8th floor room was breathtaking of the grounds and ocean. My advice is to request a room on an upper floor. I have included pictures of the room and restroom and our view. The beds, pillows, and linens are very satisfying. There are no rooms in any of the buildings that don't face the ocean, but the lower the floor the more trees to look over. The Spa Grande is well worth every penny. For a 2:00 appointment they have you arrive at 1:00 to take advantage of all the other amenities that you have available. There are different baths, whirlpools, etc that are intended to help you relax before your massage or other. The service is very impressive. The pool is tremendous. If you are thinking if your children would be entertained at the Grand, you need to know the pool is like a miniature water park. There are slides, one as long as 180 feet, a rapids slide, a water elevator, zero entry for the little ones, and a volleyball net in the larger pool. Thre is a lazy river but bring you own floatation devices because they are not provided. Some comments about the pool being crowded made me fear not getting a chair. There was never a problem when my wife and I were ready to find a place. Reference my pictures for some views of the pools. By design the hotel's rooms are a comfortable distance from the pools. Upon my check in, while looking toward the back, you can't see the pools. It isn't too far, just hidden a bit. I will be going back to The Grand Wailea. I stayed three nights at a condo prior to my checking in to The Grand and the difference in overall experience was like winning the lottery. As a whole, my experience in the area stores and shops was not the friendliest experiences. I would say most tourist places employees get tired of people. The Grandâ€™s employees are there to serve you. The only inconvenience in staying here is that you have to go down to the 4th floor, walk across the lobby area to get to another elevator to get from the 4th floor down. Not a huge deal, but a little time consuming. I am posting pictures so you can see some areas of the property.","date":"2012-06-04 00:23:26 +0300","ratings":{"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Neva Quitzon","content":"One can tell that this used to be a special place.

We were there for an awards trip and the lobby bar closed before 12 each night. When it was open, we found the informative and friendly help there the highlight of the stay. Other staff couldn't be bothered, for the most part.

Things did not get off to a good start when we arrived tired and jet lagged at 12 noon off a flight from Japan and asked whether we could check in earlier than the normal 3pm time. The front desk said that they would contact housekeeping to get our room ready early and took our mobile phone number, so they could tell us when the room was ready. Two hours passed with no contact, so we went back to the front desk. They assured us that the room was being given the express treatment. Three o'clock came and went, and at around 3:15pm we were taken by a bell hop to a filthy room which hadn't been touched. The bell hop rang down to the front, who said that they had given us the wrong room. Eventually, we were placed in the right room and the bell hop fled from embarrassment without explaining any of the room's facilities and without hanging around for a tip (the one and only time at our stay in the resort). My sense from was that housekeeping had no intention of getting a room ready before 3pm and we were just fobbed off by the front desk. After unpacking, we headed down to the pool. The place was packed. Not a free chair in sight. When we turned up poolside the next day around 10am, the same situation. This is where I part company with all those four and five star reviews for this same hotel I have read. In a true luxury hotel, you do not have to fight for a pool side seat, you do not have to rush down to the pool at the crack of dawn to place your towel on a seat, you do not have to pay $100 a day to reserve a bit of shade. This is not what a luxury hotel does. This is what a mass market, mid-level or worse hotel does. Indeed, the hotel seemed intent on gouging clients at every turn. From internet access, to umbrellas on the beach, to the daily resort charge (what is this? surely when you book a room at the price of this hotel, you assume that you will be using the resort facilities). Finally, the food was truly terrible value for money. We tried the Bistro Molokini, Grand Dining Room, Cafe Kula and the Japanese restaurant Kincha. In every case you got second rate food for around two to four times the price you would pay in a good city restaurant. Everything appeared to be out a tin, instant mix or the freezer. Given everything has to be shipped into Maui, I can see the limitations. But true luxury hotels that have island locations around the world like the Four Seasons work around this - that is why you pay big bucks: so as to get good, well cooked fresh food. At the Grand Wailea you pay big bucks to get tarted-up school canteen slop. Finally, I got caught up in the airline bankrupcty problems during my stay and had to switch my flight out to Hawaiin Airlines from Aloha. Stupidly, I thought that I could use the Grand Wailea's clout to help navigate my way through all the ticketing chaos rather than waste a whole day on the phone and internet. Of course, they were not interested in helping (even up to the Day Manager level). Again the contrast with a real luxury hotel is telling: in such hotels, the senior people at the front desk have a degree of autonomy and flexiblity in problem solving for clients. At the Grand Wailea, if it is not in their rule book, they are not interested. In conclusion, for all those people who have rated this hotel highly (and for the senior management of the Grand Wailea who don't appear to get it), all I can say is try a true luxury hotel. It costs the same you know. The experience you will have at the Mandarin, Peninsula, Four Seasons and Shangri-la is at a completely different level. Amazingly, the Waldorf Astoria has lent its brand to the Grand Wailea. I don't know what they are thinking. This is a classic way to damage a luxury brand. It fooled me into booking this hotel once, but not again! And now I will also think twice about booking any Waldorf Astoria worldwide.","date":"2014-10-06 17:04:24 +0300","ratings":{"Overall":1}},{"author":"Wilbert Brown","content":"Well, having read about how the Grand Wailea needed renovations; about how everything costs so much and nickel and diming; having read about no HHonors privileges, and kids running rampant, I had set pretty low expectations about this trip. Fortunately, my experience was the opposite of all those negative reviews! We booked 6 nights for 300,000 HHonors points, and paid $500\/night for two additional nights. I expected no upgrade, but we were upgraded to Napua Tower; I expected no HHonors \"perks\" but was immediately recognized as a Diamond member, given $25 certificate for use at Molokini Bistro, and 20% discount certificate for the spa - as well, as a welcoming letter from the manager (which said, by the way \"If you're Diamond or Gold, and we haven't been able to give you a free upgrade, you will be given other options and additional HHonors points.\" I expected moldy carpets and furniture, peeling wallpaper, and dirty tile grout in the bathroom, but got a beautifully furnished, exceptionally maintained, spacious ocean-view room - my wife was especially happy that we could sit on the lanai and see Molokini, and watch whales. I expected to be charged extra for taking a deep breath, but, really found nothing out of line with any other top-line resort. Yeah, $18 for a burger is on the high side, but, look where you get to eat it! Maybe it was just the time of our visit, but, while we saw lots of kids, they certainly were neither pervasive, nor pests. We loved the idea that there was an adult pool - with lounges available as late as 9:30 in the morning (we were never unable to find a pair near the pool) and kids were over in there's doing whatever they wanted to do. Seems Hibiscus was heated, and activity pools were not, but they were certainly not uncomfortable - and at least as warm as the ocean! The staff was friendly and helpful, the facility was beautiful and comfortable. Loved the Hospitality Suite for shower and changing clothes on last day - we checked out of our room at 2:00 PM and stayed by the pool until 5:00 PM - and easily caught our 9:40 PM flight home. And, for those who think Wailea is too haughty, I believe you've got it wrong. Wailea is maintained and manicured, for sure, but the people and the facilities are as friendly and outgoing there as anywhere on the island. And, they tolerate rednecks like me!","date":"2013-07-07 18:51:30 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":4,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":4}}],"scope":"travel","state":"Île-de-France","url":"http:\/\/www.paris-hotel-mansart.com\/en\/home","vacancy":false}

I cannot understand the negative reviews. Yes, the restaurants are expensive. Yes, they do charge a lot of money. Have you people looked around though? Everything on Maui is expensive, especially the hotels. Every hotel charges about double for drinks. If you go to a restaurant and bar off hotel premises, you will find it a lot cheaper. It is not just the Grand Weilea that charges extra for everything. We stayed at two Hotels on our stay, one which was less stars than the other, and both were comparable when it came to restaurant food and drink. My wife and I are middle class, and we stayed at this resort for 5 days. When we got to the resort, we checked ourselves in and parked our own car to save a little money. We parked our own car everyday, because they charge you money per day to use valet. When we were checked in, we were given a choice for an upgrade, either a king bed or two queens with an ocean view. We chose the ocean view, and what a spectacular view it was. Very Nice! We were very Pleased! The Parking lot is further away if you park yourself, but it was worth a few dollars saved. All resorts charge extra for their daily resort fee, and this is extra in addition to your trip fee, whether it is expedia, unitedvacations, or whatever, so expect it when you go. The Service: Excellent As said above, all you had to do was ask, and you were accomodated. We did not like the puffy pillows in the rooms, so we asked for flatter pillows in our room from housekeeping, and were immediately accomodated. On the beach, staff would help you grab chairs, give you as many towels as you wanted, and it was not too much trouble to ask for anything. Water was free all over the premises. they had tanks w\/ cups everywhere. Everyone said hello, or Aloha, or Mahalo. The Room: We were upgraded to Oceanview with two Queens. The view was amazing, and the bathroom came with a two person soaking tub, and a glass enclosed shower, which could easily fit 3 persons if you wanted. Mini bar and frig accompanied the room, and it was very tempting not to use the mini bar, but it was just too expensive. We went to the Weilea village, and were able to buy liqour and beer for less than half the price of the mini bar contents. One should expect the mini bar to be high priced though. There are complimentary robes in the room. the beds are simply plushible comfortability. The Lanai comes with two chairs and a table. The room comes with free internet via internet cable provided. Housekeeping comes twice a day, once in the morning to clean, and once in the evening to provide turn down service. I suggest leaving a couple dollars tip at least, and they will treat you right. Bell men insisted upon helping with the luggage, which we felt was very nice even though we were pretty much doing it ourselves anyway. They also have the Napua Tower, which has its own wing with it's own continental breakfast, and its own Hour d oevers and wine nightly, and also its own concierge. obviously we did not stay here, but passed by it on the way to our room everyday, and wondered about its amenities. it is available for extra dollars of course. The Service: Above Par: Now if you rent one of the cabanas for a cost on the lawn, you will have someone to wait on you and they will bring you frozen grapes all day, but we did not spend the money on the cabana. If you ask the waiter or waitresses for drinks while you are sitting in chairs though, they will gladly accomodate. We did not order too many drinks though because they are really expensive, which we knew going in (12 dollars\/mixed drink). If you didn't know this going in, I guess I could see how you could react poorly, but when you go to a resort this size, you should really do a little research. We used chairs on the beach at no cost. Really, the cabanas were not worth the money unless you have a medical condition that prevents you from being in the sun. The Spa: All we heard about when we were at the Resort was how great the Spa was. We did not use it, but apprently it is rated one of the best around. We thought about it several times, but did not want to spend the extra money since we were spending so much already. Beach and Pools: Beach is rated best in the nation many times. I have even seen it on the Travel Channel at Home. Snorkel excursions visit nearby because of all the turtles, and because of it being such a great snorkel site. The beach is pretty much immaculate, with lawn and laying chairs available, nice white sand and fairly calm waters. The pool is in itself just freaking amazing. There are a bunch of pools on a $@!#%, and all are connected by several waterslides, two big ones being the main attractions. Between the two big waterslides is the worlds only water elevator, which takes you to the top of one of the big waterslides. We understood what we paid when we saw and rode in the water elevator. There is an adult habiscus pool which is luke warm rather than the cold water pools near the bottom. There are two adult hot tubs near the adult hibiscus pool, and there is also a massage therapist near the hibiscus pool which is avaiable for a charge. there are probably a total of 5-7 hot tubs, and also several pools. there is a kiddy beach for the kids right off of the regular beach, which is made to be safer, and is really a pool\/beach for the children. There are lifeguards all around. The Land: They have about 15 million dollars put into their art work. They have tours of the resort for free just to view their art work if you like that sort of thing. They also have tours for the Flowers and landscape where they explain all that to you if you like that sort of thing also. Eating: We ate and drank very rarely at the hotels we stayed at because it was so expensive. The other hotel we stayed at was the Sheraton. It was also very very nice, and we would go back to either hotel, but the drinking and eating at both places was expensive, so we planned ahead wear to eat and drink by using Maui books bought in different stores. We sprang a little and ate breakfast once at the Grand Weilea in the Grand Dining Room the last morning we were there. My wife is a big breakfast fan, so we tried it. It was $28 pp, and even though it was a huge breakfast, and it included a lot of food, it still was not worth the dollars. That is why we planned ahead to eat off of the resorts. Other: Most people we talked to did not leave the resort, but we knew better. We did the Road to Hana, The Pipwai trail, another hike walk, and viewed many of the beaches North of Kannapali. We also did a Trilogy excurion for our Snorkel trip, and it took us to Molokini, where the water was clear about 50 feet down. We both agreed we had never seen water as clear before, and we have both snorkeled a couple of times before. Trilogy was awesome, fed us breakfast and lunch, and snacks in between, and was always asking us if we needed more to drink. I highly recommend Trilogy! You will need a car on the island if you are going off the resort. It is a negative if you do not get out of your hotel room. If you are not squeemish in the Car, do the Road to Hana, and go to the 7 Sacred Pools, and walk the Pipiwai trail (2 miles one way) Follow the pics and paragraphs in Maui Revealed. It was definitely our little blue book on this trip. Overall: If you go to Maui, I highly recommend that you do you reserach, and plan ahead. Otherwise, you will feel like a lot of others on this site that you were nickel and dimed beyond belief. If you don't expect to spend more than you think, then you will feel like you were shorted. We had an awesome Vacation staying at two hotels that were awesome. We expected to pay more than what we did up front, so expect that from the beginning. Email me for your questions or for pictures. I have a ton of them.","date":"2013-03-17 22:12:47 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":5,"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Location":4,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Cristobal Schulist","content":"This hotel is amazing!!

The room was beautiful, and the hotel itself very grand-- full of statues, flowers, fountains, beautiful sitting areas -- and then you get to the water park. Oh my goodness. They have GREAT waterslides, a water volcano, waterfalls, a pool-river that you can float along WITH rapids, a rope swing, and more. They even have a \"water elevator\" (which we did not try). We were there during the summer, so all of these attractions were quite packed with children (especially the water rapids slide, which was like a bowling alley of 9 year olds)-- but we 30-somethings managed to squeeze in and partake... It was fun! They also have one adult-only pool (which has a lot of adults lounging in it with Mai Tais)... so that one was pleasantly low-key... One thing I would say as a problem is the premium you have to pay for shade on the pool deck ($150 for the minimum two-chair accordion umbrella coverage, and goodness knows how much for a cabana). The sun is very hot and strong-- or at least it was when we were there in August. Down in the children's area, there are a few free thatch umbrellas (though people seemed to take the chairs under those quite early in the morning), but it's noisy down there-- not a super relaxing place to sit if you're a couple without kids. On the beach area you can rent an umbrella-- not sure how much that is, but I just think, if you are paying that much for a room, they shouldn't be so stingy with the shade. We have stayed at less expensive beach hotels elsewhere in the world (Mexico, Bermuda) where beach umbrellas were part of the deal... Anyway, we just stayed here one night, as we wanted to move around Maui and spend our days out touring and snorkeling, etc (if we are paying that much for a hotel, we didn't want to be out doing activities all day). One day\/night was good to experience the \"oh WOW\" factor, but of course, two nights or more will be more relaxing...

The setting is beautiful but the rooms, the staff, the cleanliness and the service left us wondering what we were paying so much money for. Our room suffered from deferred maintenance; the bedding was not clean; the mattress was broken down on one side; the tile in the bathroom was stained and often not cleaned well by housekeeping; the shower head leaked more water from the valve than it sprayed. When asked to leave extra towels, housekeeping simply took the tip and moved the note to the nightstand, ignoring the request entirely. We reserved and paid $275.00 in advance for a cabana at the pool and had to spend the entire day policing the chairs that were included with the cabana because the hotel does not provide different towels to indicate that those are reserved chairs. When we asked for a different cabana location after our third day in the same one (we wanted a change of scenery), we were told that we could have that same cabana or none. The food was mediocre at best, and very expensive, although the wait staff at every place we ate was friendly and helpful. On the fourth day we sought the assistance of a manager for the smelly bedding and inability to get enough towels for each of us to have just one. The solution was to remove the feather bed and down comforter and leave us with a lightweight blanket and cheap mattress pad. The attitude was \"if you don't like it we can make it worse for you.\" Our bill was in excess of $1200. per day with the standard room in the lagoon wing, cabana and food we charged to the room-not worth it for that kind of attitude! We checked out on the fifth day and moved to The Four Seasons where we had exquisite service, food and our room was clean and free of deferred maintenance. Our bill was much lower and our vacation was revived.","date":"2012-08-04 18:13:34 +0300","ratings":{"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Location":4,"Overall":1,"Rooms":1,"Service":1,"Value":1}},{"author":"Kaylee Lowe","content":"We just completed another stay at the GWR in late may early June and we had a great time. What the Grand Wailea is: Very expensive, cannot be mentioned in the same sentence with Four Seasons, Ritz and JW's in service; mediocre in food and has the audacity to charge handsomely for shade at the pool. Why do we keep coming back? The resort itself is amazing. The pools are the highlight, the beach is one of the best anywhere, the offshore reef is an easy swim to see the sea turtles, and the artwork and gardens make you feel like you've found paradise. We were guests in 1991 when the resort opened and again shortly after the hotel was award 5 Diamonds so we are dissapointed that the hotel has becom indifferent to all the small things that differentiate a good resort from a great one. But let's face it, this place is fun, beautiful and if you are a business person who spends significant time away from the family, the GWR allows you to have fun together as a family and reconnect. To maximize your enjoyment of the resort you need to go in understanding that you won't have the personal service of the 4S, yes a drink will cost $13 at the pool and this is an activity based resort, lot's of kids and adults who are acting like kids. If you want quiet this is not the place for you. My last advice is eat offsite when you can. We had great meals at Joe's at the Wailea tennis club go at sunset and order the pumpkin seed coated Mahi. If you're in the mood for a steak, Ruth Chris is next door.

There are no waves on Wailea beach so we had to go to Lahaina for surfing and that was about 45 minutes away. We stayed in the Napua tower and enjoyed the morning breakfast and afternoon appetizers and cocktails. I also went to the spa and it was amazing. I have been to many spas but none quite as pampering as the Grand. My husband said he enjoyed the gym and that is was large for a hotel gym.

As soon as our taxi from the airport arrived at the hotel the bellhop happly opened the door and gave us leis and offered to take our bags, aftering accepting there offer they directed us to the check in desk. The line was rather long but it went rather quickly. After receiving our room keys the same bellhop that assisted us upon arrival showed us to our rooms and asked if there was anything else we needed. After he left we toured our room which was actually very nice, but deffinatlly not worth the $700 price tag. The bathroom was very nice and very clean, but in other parts of the room there were defiant signs of aging as you could see wood chips missing from the closet door and from the bathroom door. But overall the only thing that really I disliked was the fact that there was a stain on one of our pillows that looked of blood. Emidiately we called house keeping who showed up very shortly (withing 10 minutes) and genuanly apologised for the inconvenience. After looking at our room we toured the property and decided to try and go for a swim aftering getting into our swimsuits and going down to the pool it was shocking to find out that towels were not being given out beyond six even though the pool was open till 10:00. So we went back up to the room ordered room service and ended the day. On our first day we went to the pool at about 10 AM and found the pools to be absolutley amazing, but at the same time very crowded with other familys. The adult pool though was like walking into another world it was very quite and had attentative service. One thing we were very happy about though was that there were pool chairs avaliable, becaue after reading the horror stories of having to come out at six in the morning to get a chair we began to worry. Later on that evening me and my son decided to go to the spa for the evening and both agreed that it was above and beyond what we had expected. On our last day at the Grand Wailea we came out to the pool at noon and to our amazment the horror stories were true no chairs were avaliable, but and excellent pool staff member gladly helped up out by finding us two chairs. She even offered to get our pool towels and wrist bands for us as an apology, but we declained not wanting to be a burdan.

We've typically rented one of the 2\/3 BR Villas over at the Kea Lani, but decided to get two adjoining deluxe oceanfront rooms. The \"membership\" is mostly a rip-off. We did get our \"discount\" but this is calculated from the HIGHEST published rates, and was hardly a bargain. The nickel and dime fees were maddening: There is the resort fee $20, Valet fee, $15, Adjoining Room Fee $20 ea. as well as the usual excise fees. So this added up to about $100\/night more than the \"discounted rate\" for each of the rooms ($1800 over our entire stay) With Maui, the prices are always high...but at the GW, they are outrageous, and the quality of the food was just not good at Bistro Molokini or the Volcano Bar. $25 for a cold, undercooked burger, a bag of Maui chips and a warm beer served by the horribly overworked pool wait staff was typical. We routinely went over to the 4 Seasons next door for breakfast because the food and service were excellent, and the prices were cheaper. The Kula Cafe had great food and the prices were sane The location was great, and we had excellent dinners at Ruths, Spago, Ferraros, Tommy Bahama Cafe, and Fire Dragon (mediocre) as well a few others farther away. Service ranged from disdainful\/indifferent to excellent, depending on the situation. The attitude is pretty much one of \"if you don't like this place, go away....there are 10 more in line\", but there were a few people that were really nice and provided excellent service. The whole place was understaffed. At check in, it took us 45 minutes of standing in line, waiting on only 3 clerks. The whole place was dated, and worn out. Cracking stone, in the common areas, flagstone falling off, tile coming off the bond beams on the pools, etc. The hotel has obviously been really popular and looks like the hotels right around large convention centers that get enormous trade show traffic. The water features are cool, but the kids hated the line for the water elevator and ditched that after the first 2 or 3 times. The slides are long, and for safety's sake, the guards wait until the riders have cleared the bottom before sending the next rider. Unfortunately, this really makes the cycle time long and the lines are huge. My kids were sick of the waterslides after a day or two. I did get a charge out of the gamesmanship necessary to get coveted poolside chairs. If you aren't waiting in line by 6:45 and ready to get personal belongings onto the chairs as soon as you walk down, you are toast. There is an attendant walking around photographing \"unattended\" chairs to try to cut down on the \"land grabs\" but it is a tough job. In the summer, it must be completely nuts.

All I can really say about the hotel is it was average. Staff: Very friendly Grounds: very nice, but a bit too big for a honeymoon couple wanting a little romance. I could see how it would be good for a family with kids. The grounds are very pretty, but we did see a dead koi fish in one of the ponds and a large roach walking around. Restaurants: The Humuhumu... restaurant was expensive, but was not very good. The Kincha Japanese buffet (fri. & mon. - $50 ) was very good. The mini-burgers that can be ordered from the Botero bar were delicious, but kinda pricey at $20. Room service was served quickly, but the food was just average. Housekeeping: The rooms were kept very clean. When we returned from our daily excursions, the rooms were always cleaned and new amenities were provided. We did however find one roach in our room and we were occasionally visited by a few ants. Recommendations if staying at the Grand Wailea: Go to the ABC store located next door at the Shops at Wailea, to puchase essentials (water, soda, snacks, etc.), it'll save you A LOT of money. If you like sea food, you must try Mama's Fish House, located in Paia (about 30 min. drive from hotel).

A few weeks ago, we decided to try the Grand Wailea since we heard it was the best hotel on the island. From the outside, the hotel looked very promising. The exterior was beautiful, the pools spectacular, and the beach access unbeatable. But from the moment we pulled up to the valet, we realized that the hotel was simply a body without a soul. As we pulled up, we had to wait a minute or so before we were \"greeted\" by a valet. In fact, we had already unloaded our bags before one of the valets finally showed up. As we walked into the lobby, the female greeter uninterestedly placed leis (sp ?) around our necks. She didnt even bother smiling. I contrast this with the warmth and friendliness that greeted us everytime we arrived at the Fairmont. We arrived at the hotel at approximately 3:30pm, which is about half an hour past the official check in time. However, our room was still not available and we were asked to simply wander about the hotel and were told that we would get a call on our cell phone when our room was ready. Half an hour later we still had not received a call and decided to go back to the front desk. After waiting a somewhat lengthy time to finally speak to a front desk person, we were told that our room was ready. Where was that phone call? When we got to our room, we were fairly unimpressed. The bathroom looked dated and the overall size was smaller than the rooms at the Fairmont. The pool area is truly the gem of this hotel. There are something like 10 pools and various slides and water attractions. However, if you're an adult, you might find the number of screaming kids a bit overwhelming. The hotel had a feel comparable to your average waterpark. Nevertheless, my friends and I still enjoyed the pool. The easy beach access was also a positive as it was just a few steps from the pool area. My biggest complaint about the hotel is the service, or lack thereof. There was none of the island love, or general hospitality that you would expect from a 5 star resort, or more importantly a hotel that costs 500-900 bucks a night. The staff members rarely smiled, they seemed bothered when you approach them with a question, and generally seem out of place at a high-end resort. None of the little touches were found at the Grand Wailea. For example, at the Fairmont, smiling pool side employees would frequently walk around handing out fresh pineapples. At the Marriott Ihilani in Oahu, they had a jolly guy walking around the pool spritzing cool water on the feet of hotel guests. Those little things are so important when you pay the kind of rates you pay at the Grand Wailea. The capper to our 5 day stay was the jack hammering that started at 7:30AM during the last 2 days of our stay. Imagine if you will, waking up in paradise to loud jack hammering...at 7:30 in the freaking morning. When we complained during the last day, they told us that they had left letters in our rooms telling us of the jackhammering. First, we didnt get a letter. Second, who cares if you they left a letter? Why not wait until a more reasonable time to start causing that kind of noise. Fortunately they decided to comp us one night which made the experience slightly more bearable. My last memory of the Grand Wailea was back in the valet. After the valet pulled up the car for the final time, he sat there and watched as my friends and I struggled to place the bags in our trunk. No offer to help. Needless to stay, I will never again stay at this hotel. I've warned my friends who are planning trips to Hawaii to stay away from this place. If this was a normal 200 dollar a night hotel, I really wouldnt have cared. But paying Grand Wailea rates for Motel 6 service is just unacceptable.","date":"2013-01-30 20:27:43 +0300","ratings":{"Business service (e.g., internet access)":3,"Check in \/ front desk":2,"Cleanliness":3,"Location":5,"Overall":2,"Rooms":2,"Service":1,"Value":2}},{"author":"Omari Casper","content":"I am looking at the ocean in my Grand Wailea ocean view right now. The room is good, quite spacious and I CAN see the ocean from my 6th floor room (I guess we got lucky). Hotel grounds are lovely and extensive with loads of Koi ponds and waterfalls. It's peak season so the pools are filled with kids but the beach isn't crowded and it's easier to get a chair. I'd recommend the room + Breakfast package as the buffet is fine and it'll probably cost you more to eat a la carte. The staff are friendly but I wouldn't say that they go the extra mile considering the hotel rating and room prices. I have had better at Ritz Carlton, Westin and other 5* hotels. I'll agree that they do Nickel and Dime you, although you wish it were just Nickels and Dimes. The hotel is expensive, to eat, sleep and play will cost you a pretty penny! But I've looked at some of the other hotels (including the Four Seasons next door) and this one may just have one of the best overall packages for pools, gardens, beach, eating and accommodation. It's probably especially good for families as the kids will swim all day. That said I couldn't give it top marks because for the high cost there are no hammocks between palms (come on this is Hawaii it's what you'd expect), the staff could do better, everything closses at 9:30 and the overall finish isn't the best, so the Wow factor is low. To end there was a bit of a fiasco at checkin with room availability that many people seemed to be suffering from, we had to stay in a garden view room for the first night (they comped it though and gave us a drink at the bar!!). The reason for the problems are that Hilton have bought the hotel and decided to change booking systems mid peak season that has caused a few headaches, we were patient though and were rewarded for it.","date":"2014-05-20 07:06:13 +0300","ratings":{"Check in \/ front desk":4,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Raina Mraz","content":"I just returned from a week at the grand wailea, and can honestly say it was one of the finest resorts I have ever visited. Yes, there are some minor flaws, but nothing I experienced merited some of the lambasting reviews posted here, which made me quite nervous, as I had booked the hotel months ago. First off: the rooms are normal. They do not measure up to the standard of the JW Marriott on Oahu, but did not seem inadequate either. Luckily, we were upgraded to the Wailea suite, a large two-bedroom room with a full refrigerator and table. It is worth requesting an upgrade, I can tell you that. The parlor made it hard to leave in the morning. The grounds are filled with tropical gardens which are sprinkled with great works of art, and the grounds don't seem tacky, but like a true tropical paradise, which is lucky because you will be doing a lot of walking. I got lost several times on the first day. The pool is incredible: it consists of several pools linked by tile slides, emptying into a main activity pool, which is rarely crowded. There is a separate adult pool: during my stay, it never had more than 10 people in it. The poolside dining is varied and tasty. There is little shade here, which makes renting a cabana useful, but at $200, it is a bit of a ripoff, even though they do deliver fruit, water, towels, cold towels, frozen grapes, and icepops throughout the day. The pool staff is a bit unprofessional, something not relfected throughout the rest of the resort. Nevertheless, the activity pool (the one with the slides) never felt like a waterpark, but instead like a particularly nice complement to Wailea Beach, the best beach I have ever visited. It has everything: nice sand, equipment rentals, crystal clear water, and even snorkeling in the morning. I recommend going out early just beyond the rocks at the neighboring Four Seasons to see a cornucopia of aquatic biodiversity. One woman spotted a green sea turtle. The beach has waves, which invariably heightened during the afternoon, making for some entertaining waveriding. After an enjoyable day, it would be nice to have a good hotel dinner to look forward to, but the restaurants here fall short, for the most part, of the resort's opulence. Kincha, the japanese restaurant, is the best at the place. HumuHumu was well overpriced, and mediocre. Finally, Bistro Molokini was good for lunch, but had a limited and expensive menu. Most things here are overpriced, even for hawaii, which is my only fault with the place. Room service is always expensive, I know, but a $6 can of soda, an $11 bagel, and the breakfast buffet for $27 (limited selection) all seemed disgustingly overpriced. Wailea in general seems this way. I would recommend a trip to Spago, at the four seasons, for great service and even better food. The golf is also spectacular, and their private lessons are very helpful. For families, or even active adults, the Grand Wiailea seems like the best choice on maui. It is palatial, and grand in every sense of the word. Bottom line, is that the four seasons looked nice, but if the kids in my party ever wandered over the the Wailea activity pool, they would be very jealous. My one regret is not venturing into Lahaina, where the restaurant selection seemed more diverse than on the south side of the island.","date":"2012-03-30 16:27:30 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":4,"Service":4,"Value":3}},{"author":"Macey Cartwright","content":"We spent one week of our three week Hawaii trip at the Grand Wailea. We did not read the reviews before we went because we received the trip as an incentive package from one of the vendors from our heating & air conditioning business on the east coast of US. In response to reviews we read after returing home to write a review I offer the following: We though the place was fantastic. The grounds in our opinion were beautiful. Our oceanview room was spacious with standard ammenties that we would expect at this level of resort. Large soaking tub and seperate shower for two, seperate toilet room, sitting area in room, desk with high speed internet, lani with seating. The room was comfortable, bedding was fine, no noise from outside. Maid service was fine. The pool area was busy, I did not want a cabana but if I would have I would has planned in advance. We travel alot, usally in 4 star plus accommadations, in doesn't make any difference how much you pay there are allways people that don't know how to conduct themselves. Every time we went to the pool there were no \"open\" chairs. This day and age even with the hotel claiming they watch for unused but \"saved\" chairs you have to take matters into your own hands. If there were just towels, not personal items, we pitched them in the used towel bin and replaced them with clean ones. Big deal, if some one presented themselves stating that the chairs were theirs and we had been there the hotels limit of one hour we would tell them that the hotel cleared their towels, go speak to someone with the hotel as we are using the chairs and are not leaving. No one ever presented themselves. Many reviews stated about things being run down, yes our room could have been touched up where people knocked their luggage in to the wall, but who cares about a few of the million plus pool tiles being broken. The hotel was hosting a group of 750 from Sprint also when we were there (4\/23 to 4\/29). Someone claimed they over booked and paid them to move to another hotel but allowed them to use the facilities. They put some Sprint folks up next door at the Four Seasons. Some of the people from other hotels using the Grand's pool were authorized but I am sure there were some ousiders also. The hotel actually gives a wrist band to help keep unauotherized folks out, good luck pool police ! Yes everything is expensive at the Grand, and in Hawaii in general. One person complained that the resturants were so expensive that they were eating PBJ sandwich's to get by. What did they expect? They should do a little more research befor they book next time. We ate at the fancy \"HunHun\", of something like that, one night, expensive yes, food was excellent, service was okay, waitress had zero personality, never did return to see if everything was okay. We have had better service in a $5.00 a plate diner, or a $100.00 a plate fine dinning place, but we have also had the worst service possible in both of these extremes. You could blame the hotel for employing them but, when you look a the housing and wage difference in Hawaii It's a wonder to me that they can have enough people to serve us travelers who invade their homeland and expect everyone to bow to them because we have enough money to get there!

I have been fortunate enough to stay at some excellent island hotels in my lifetime, but the Grand Wailea stands head and shoulders above the others. This hotel had everything that I could have wanted in a beachfront hotel. After a long day of travel, we were greeted by cheerful attendants that leid us as bellmen wisked away our luggage. The front desk was also quite welcome- upgrading us to a deluxe garden room along a quiet wing of the hotel. As the bellman took us to our room, he gave us a great tour of the hotel and we took in the grounds as best we could in the middle of the night. Our room was fantastic, with a huge terrace and an amazing bathroom with whirlpool and stall shower. They say garden view, but in a rare bit of humility (a rare thing in the hotel business), this room had garden, ocean and mountain views. In the morning, we paroused the grounds and my suspicions were confirmed- the inky darkness that we looked out on the previous night was a paradise come morning. I really enjoyed this hotel because of the SCOPE of the hotel. It is a large hotel, but never did we feel cramped or inindated with noise. It had cuisine ranging from a simple breakfast place to get pastries to fine dining- it had pool areas for families AND adults. This hotel had taken into consideration EVERYONE that visited it. Whether you wanted a $10 or a $40 breakfast, whether you wanted to play in the family pool on the slide complex (do it at least once, its that impressive) or slip into the quiet hibiscus pool with a drink and a private cabane waiting for you when you get out, this place was perfect. *****- a wonderful combination in a package that doesnt overwhelm, the Grand Wailea is a keeper, and should be higher on this list of Maui's best hotels. A couple of tips: the water slides close 5pm and there is no shuttle service to anything on the island, so seriously consider renting a car if you wish to leave hotel property.","date":"2013-08-10 00:20:18 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Value":5}},{"author":"Juliana Rolfson","content":"While I've never felt compelled to review a hotel before, I felt the the expectation of this hotel was far enough from the reality that I had to warn potential visitors. First of all, the room that we received was dingy, in major need of an update, and an enormous disappointment in general. I went downstairs to request an upgrade and they did accommodate us with a room in the concierge tower. The bellhop who took our luggage from the old room to the new explained to us that the room was handicapped accesible and in the area that had not yet been renovated. I got the strong feeling that they try to pass this section of rooms off to people who might otherwise not complain and just accept it - much like a bad table in a restaurant. While the new room was an improvement, it was still not what I expected from this hotel. The room was merely average at this point as far as I was concerned. The next thing that struck me was the clientele. Not a refined bunch to say the least. This was surprisingly a very tatooed, twenty-something, roudy type of crowd. Very small on manners and big on implants. Looked more like spring break in Fort Lauderdale. Staff not too polished either. Last complaint is the food. Mediocre at best. We did have a nice (not spectacular) dinner, however at Humu. If I were to do it again, we would stay at the Four Seasons. Much smaller and less impressive grounds (the reason we chose not to stay there in the first place), but much more refined clientele and staff. More in line with what we were anticipating from Grand Wailea. The beach has nothing on Kannapali - where we went next. Very happy that we only had two nights at Grand Wailea.","date":"2014-06-23 07:27:17 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":2,"Overall":3,"Rooms":2,"Service":2,"Value":2}},{"author":"Hulda Von","content":"I've not only stayed at the Grand Wailea but I was also a member. I used to stay there almost every year but every time I went, the maintanence of the hotel seemed to be going more and more down-hill. Also, the water in the pools is not heated so if it's not really hot, it gets ridiculously cold. So cold that one year, not one person was in the pool during most of my stay!! The hotel is very beautiful but can get very crowded with conventions and then it becomes overly busy and soon your serene vacation is ruined with kids running around like maniacs. Also, one year, the valet damaged my rental car. Wailea is my favorite area on Maui because it stays dryer. I recommend staying at another hotel in the Wailea area and going over and visiting the Grand Wailea and see if it's for you for a future trip.","date":"2014-11-28 13:56:36 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":2,"Overall":3,"Rooms":4,"Service":3,"Value":2}},{"author":"Louvenia Jewess","content":"Our family stays at 5 star\/apple resorts every year so we have apples to compare with this apple. To put it succinctly......the resort is outrageously pricey and does not provide the services the guests should be entitled to after already paying for overpriced rooms. Examples are the $14 hamburgers (not gourmet) at the pool side and a $26 breakfast buffet that is just so so, paying $120 or more per day for cabanas. ( Shade around the pool is at a premium). Customer service was stretching to make average. The spa was nice, but customer service in the spa and spa shop were surprisingly poor. Guest should not have to pay an $18.00 resort fee. The list goes on. The size of the room for the price was just okay. The bathroom is very nice, except we noticed that there was mold moderate mold in grouting between tiles in shower. The maid service did not clean the room well each day and we were tipping $7-8 each day. To worsen matters, the hotel put a hold of several thousand $$$ on our credit card even though, we had prepaid for our 8 day stay there. This turned out to be a major problem that took up too much of our vacation time to straighten out. In all fairness the manager, in the end gave us about a $500 credit for the inconvenience after I insisted they credit us for one nights stay. This was a compromise. It took them 3 days to get the matter corrected. Then we had smoke from the adjoining room coming through the cracks of the door between the two rooms. I have a serious lung condition and notified the front desk about the cigarette smoking in a non-smoking area. Their solution was to offer to move us to another room. I responded no, we were not going to waste anymore of our vacation time resolving problems they create.....a better solution would be to notify the other guest and ask them to desist from smoking or to move them. Again, poor customer service. In the end they put a air ionizer in our room. Thankfully, we were leaving the next day. What's good about this place? The grounds are stunningly beautiful, a great stretch of beach connected to the resort and the artwork throughout the resort is magnificent! The bathroom area is a plus for size and design. This kind of beauty can be experienced for less $$$ and with staff that treat you like royalty, or at least a valued guest. Hint.....If you do visit this resort, try eating breakfast at the restaurant next door at the Wailea shoppes. It's very good and won't cost you an arm & a leg. Generally speaking, food away from the resort is reasonably priced and I recommend dinner at the golf course up the road. Very nice! We also ate at the Four Seasons. The dinner was was wonderful and the service was perfect!!!!","date":"2013-02-02 15:32:03 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":2,"Overall":2,"Service":2,"Value":2}}],"scope":"travel","state":"Île-de-France","url":"http:\/\/www.ritzparis.com\/","vacancy":false}

We thought everyone who worked here had a superior customer service attitude. The food was good though we never did eat dinner here (ate at Ruth's Chris..ummm). Just lunch at the restaurant near the adult pool and breakfast. I thought the lunch at the pool was excellent, and the service was great! Our room was located on the first floor very near the pool with a lovely view of the chapel and gardens. You could see the ocean if you really looked, but that was ok as I knew our next stop had a complete view of the ocean so I wasn't going to be missing anything. I loved it...totally serene and even saw someone getting married. Very pretty. Very easy to get to the pool! The bathroom was large and decorated tastefully. I thought everything about the hotel was worth the price. Just beautiful and the pools looked like a lot of fun. The disappointment for me was that our room smelled like mildew and with the fan blowing overhead all night the smell gave me a horrible headache. If you are like me and have a sensitivity to smells, this might bother you too. I felt sick most of the day after our first night so I could not do all the fun things I had wanted to do (especailly go down the water slide!!! Darn!!!) When I woke up the next day, same thing...headache. So, that pretty much ruined everything. As soon as I could get fresh air (which I rushed out of the room and didn't enjoy relaxing in it at all) I was better, but really disappointed that the smell was in the room. I did not mention it to the hotel staff....I loved where the room was located, I did not want to have to pack and unpack while feeling so poorly and I knew it was only 2 nights. My husband thought the place had an unfriendly air to it....not due to the staff but more the guests. Too many people on cell phones non-stop gabbing while laying out at the pool! Come on guys! You're in Maui! RELAX! Guess we are more \"kick back\" as we loved staying in Kanapali. Seems a little more relaxed to us. Anyway....the place is a dream but.......ask about the mildew.....I swear the carpet felt damp. I have no idea how they would have handled the situation had I complained but I hated to start out my vacation complaining.

No matter what you like to do on your vacation this place had it all. It was right next door to a beautiful outdoor mall (the shops at wailea). You could lay out on the beach, swim in one of the 6 pools, go down the water slides, shop, eat, bike, hike, sightsee, you name it you can do it at the wailea.

We brought our two kids-ages 8 & 6. This was the ideal resort for us. Luxurious and romantic, yet fun for all. I don't know how I would feel about all the families if I was a honeymooner, but hey, I'm 36 and I LOVE a good waterslide so if you are comfortable with happy kids around you, you will be happy here. Booked a terrace room (least $$$) in the Molokini wing. Our view was of the mountain and the 4 Seasons next door. After extensively touring the resort and taking advantage of its many facilities, I think the location of our room was ideal! Close to the pool & beach and also convenient get a cup of coffee and a quick breakfast at the cafe. We didn't experience any long hikes anywhere we wanted to go. We met a family staying in the Napua (concierge) while tir room was lovely, we had to take two elevators to get there from the pool. Ugh. The pool and beach area is excellent. It's windy and split up into several areas. I think this design accommodates the crowds well because we never felt like we were swarmed by people. We got the same spot at the pool every day. If you like convenient access between beach and pool, the GW is ideal. Both the Fairmont Kea lani & the 4 Seasons wailea are beautiful but you either sit at the pool OR the beach, not both. The pool area at GW flows seamlessly into the beach, including the public beach walk. It has very good feng shui in that regard. Meals at the resort were disappointing overall. Food at the pool is way overpriced and bland. After 5 days I was tired of the same salads and sandwiches. We enjoyed two lovely dinners at Bistro Molokini where the food was good but not memorable. Our best meal was the buffet breakfast at the 4 seasons-it was an easy early morning walk and a great food. Camp Grande was great. We never dropped our children off there but you can freely use the facility at your leaisure. There are video games and computer games and two nice toy rooms for kids. It was a great place to hang out before dinner. We also took the kids to a hula class and a lei making class at the camp. They charge a ridiculous $20 for each session, but the kids had a blast. Counselors were lovely and seemed to truly enjoy their jobs. About the spa. WOW! I booked a lava stone massage. After the first hour in the hydrotherapy baths, I could have gone home happy. The massage was icing on the cake. My experience at the spa was fabulous. I thought the staff was friendlyand gracious but not overly so. I had no complaints other than the fact that I spent over $200 in less than two hours. We were all sad to leave the Grand Wailea. The thing was, while we were there, we hadn't seen Hawaii! We couldn't bring ourselves to leave the resort too long. It's really a destination resort because there is enough to do (or not do) that you are completely satisfied. All of our sightseeing took place after we left and were staying in Kaanapali. The Grand Wailea was just too good to be apart from for long.

The free WiFi internet access from every room is now a real plus as well as is free parking. However, donâ€™t be fooled: these perks and others are not really free so to speak and come with a mandatory USD17.50 + tax daily resort fee, something unique and contagious within Hawaiiâ€™s resorts that is simply extorsion to me.

The flat panel TV set is hooked on a wall facing the sofa. However, since this TV is not moveable watching programs from your bed is not comfortable since you only get a limited side view.

We saw one particular situation where a guest was upset over a non-guestâ€™s behavior. ***Be aware, not everyone at the pool and bar are paying patrons to the hotel.*** Bike Rentals: you can rent 10 speed and beach cruisers for free (this is included in the $17.50 per day). Rooms: Very clean. Odd numbered rooms have a great views of the mountains and the ocean. Our room had a beautiful sunrise and sunset view. We had a remodeled suit which was large, had a mini kitchenette area, 2 flat screen televisions, couch in the living room, king bed in the bedroom, and 2 sliding doors. Large bathroom with great water pressure. Bathroom has a mirror that does not fog up while taking a shower. It leaves the middle area on the mirror unfogged which was great! Bathtub side was a bit high (especially if you're short), so watch your shins. Parking: Ample parking. Well lit and safe. Cafe O'le was a great lunch spot and close to the hotel after you get off the plane and wait for your room. Maui Coffee was excellent and close to the hotel. 4 Seasons Hotel has great restaurants. Ferraro's was excellent.","date":"2015-03-09 09:59:16 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":4,"Overall":4,"Rooms":5,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":4}},{"author":"Evert Harber","content":"We had a a two-bed unit (#255).

I especially liked the electricity outlets at the bottom of the light units, providing plenty of outlets to recharge all electronics. The staff was friendly. The pool is basic compared to some of the larger resorts. There is a bar\/cabana next to the pool. I did not go to the beach, but it is a somewhat long walk due to the length of the Maui Coast Hotel and the street crossing.

We were provided a complimentary bottle of wine for our honeymoon. The only downside for us was the location. It was an ok location, but not the best.

It's not on the beach. It's not in the loveliest part of Maui (Kihei in general is looking pretty old). The restaurant needs a complete overhaul. So, why stay here at all? Because you will not receive finer service anywhere. The staff, from front desk to housekeeping to the shuttle drivers, are all simply wonderful. Your room will be short on luxury but very long on comfort. Our one bedroom suite had a fabulous king bed as well as a sofabed in the living room area, and had 2 plasma TV's. I believe most rooms come with a mini fridge, microwave and coffeemaker. The room was kept spotless by our kind and lovely housekeeper, who always asked what time she should service the room. I locked myself out of the room one day with no ID etc. One of the desk clerks actually delivered a new room key to me where I was sitting by the pool. Now that is service!!! We liked the complimentary shuttle, which will take you 3 miles in either direction. To the north you'll find plenty of strip malls with grocery stores and casual eateries. To the south you can get a ride to Wailea, full of gorgeous resorts, restaurants and a shopping mall. Also complimentary are bikes and use of 3 computers in the lobby. The pool is okay, nothing fancy but attractive enough and we could usually find a vacant chaise. We did not care for the adjoining bar or the restaurant. Breakfast is fine, but we were served a couple of inedible lunches and decided to skip it for the remainder of our 2 week stay. We also liked that we could walk to a great beach in about 5 minutes, and 2 more great beaches were beyond that. There re plenty of small sandwich joints across from all the beaches, so having a picnic on the beach is no problem. We'd highly recommend this place overall. If you are coming to Kihei for any length of time, you may want to consider renting a beachfront condo with a kitchen. If you're going for business, or for a short stay to check out this side of Maui, you couldn't do any better.

After checking back the next morning I was given a room on the third floor (reservation was for an ocean view room and I never got one but since I was only paying $150 per night I couldn't really complain). TIP: odd numbered rooms or rooms on the top three floors have ocean views... no ocean view from the first or third floor on the even numbered side of the hotel. The grounds of the hotel were clean and attractive. I never swam in the pool but it appeared to be a nice set up. The rooms were a bit dated and the air conditioning was loud. The bathroom was clean but very very small... and it had the most annoying shower curtain that was short and would blow into the shower while showering... when I tried to correct this I ended up flooding the floor... no winning with that! I found the hotel to be quite quiet given the fact that it was booked solid. Free internet in the lobby and free parking were a nice bonus as was the mini refrigerator in the room. The hotel is situated across from the beach in busy Kihei but since it is set back from the road it was quite quiet. I ate breakfast one morning in the hotel restaurant and it was okay, service was friendly but slow. Would I recommend this hotel to a friend, probably not as I would recommend a condo instead (a condo is a must if you are traveling with children).

The large rooms are everything you expect from a first class resort. The resortâ€™s biggest amenity is its location. The beautiful beach is the envy of south Maui.

The pool is simple but very inviting, and the waitstaff will take care of everything you need. We enjoyed the Friday night seafood buffet, and the chef personally cut select sushi for us.

There seems to be more staff and the service was friendly and consistant. We were greeted each day, from the front desk staff, the breakfast servers and the gardeners with a big smile and an Aloha. The breakfast buffet that was included in our room rate was superb. From made to order omlettes, fresh fruit and waffles and pancakes there was something for everyone. The beach is what keeps bringing us back. Even though the hotel was full the beach was never crowded. My husband and daughter were able to swim out to Turtle Town right from the front of the hotel. The nice surprise this time was the added activities that were available to guests with a variety each day. We went to the \"Night Under The Stars\" and found the whole experience a lot of fun. Becky was informative, entertaining and enthusiastic. Whether you are a couple or a family there is something for everyone. The location was perfect and the fire and smores just added to the experience. We have only been home for two days and we are already talking about when we can return.

The resort is south of Wailea on a secluded, beautiful beach, but still close enough to take advantage of the restaurants in Wailea or Kihei. We were told at check-in that the room renovations had been complete. Our room was comfortable with a partial ocean view and a lovely lanai, but the carpet was dirty in several places. Occasionally, we found tiny bugs in the bathroom. Whatâ€™s worse was all the light switches were filthy! Iâ€™ve never experienced that anywhere. We had purchased a package on Expedia that included the breakfast buffet (normally $25pp). The selection was great. Two days we had great service (bringing beverages and removing plates) but the third day we had to ask for coffee after looking for a server for 10 minutes. The service at the pool at lunch time was also poor. (There is nowhere else to eat at the resort at lunch time.) When we first arrived at the pool, the waitperson kept asking us if we wanted to order and we said not yet. When we told her we were ready to order, she forgot about us for about 15 minutes. She also forgot a couple of other things that we requested during the afternoon. We were there in early December and the resort seemed like it had were more staff than guests. Maybe the resort was still getting back to normal after the renovation, but it was a little spooky with only a few people around. In sum, I think I would stay there again because of the location and beach and hope that the service and cleanliness had improved.","date":"2012-07-05 09:54:39 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":2,"Location":5,"Overall":3,"Rooms":4,"Service":2,"Sleep Quality":3,"Value":3}},{"author":"Adan Lueilwitz","content":"Here's the deal with this property.

The result is that the prior negative reviews referencing the Adams Family, Hitchcock films, etc. are not completely offbase as the hotel is a bit stark and bland in general. I had already stayed for a few nights in West Maui so I only wanted 2 days\/1 night in the Wailea area to check out South Maui before I left the island. I didn't want to pay $500+ for the Four Seasons or Grand Wailea and was able to book Makena for $199 inclusive of breakfast and the resort fee. The manager upgraded me to a better Ocean View room when I checked in without my having to badger him for it...in fact, the entire staff was very friendly and helpful the entire time I was there and are an asset to the hotel. I can confirm the prior reviews regarding the room...great views, nice bed, bland decor, elements that make you shake your head at the design flaws, cheap patio furniture that I constantly tripped over, etc. The hotel beach is nice. If you have a car drive to Big Beach 5 minutes down the road.

Since then, he didn't smile at all, and had a poker face toward us, and very impatient to our questions regarding the hotel facilities and internet access. I understand his job may be stressful. But his behavior just made us feel unwelcome, disrespectful and upset after a long and tired flight trip to Maui and this quality of service is unacceptable as it is a 4-star resort. In addition, the room is clean but a bit old and certainly update is needed. Other staffs are really friendly and helpful and I would like to say thank you for their quality service.

Because of false advertisement of policy at the chain resort, we checked out of the chain the next morning . . . things were not looking good. We used our Frommer's Guide to try to find another resort on Maui for our next 6 nights. Frommer's listed this resort, formerly known as Maui Prince as an 2.5 star rating at the end of its list of resort listings. Going down the list and fearing that we were going to have to hotel hop (Kea Lani could put us up for 4 nights), we finally got to the end of the list and this listing. From the moment the reservationist answered our call, everything went \"right.\" Even though she didn't show an availability for 6 nights, understanding our dilemma, she put us on hold to speak with upper management and successfully secured us a room with balcony for the entire 6 nights for around $300 per night which included 24 hr. internet service, resort fee and valet parking (as we found at the chain all of this is very pricey). Given our situation (Maui for 6 nights and no lodging), we left the chain and headed south fearing what shape 2.5 stars meant. When we pulled into the resort, we thought for certain we were at the wrong place . . . it was beautiful, just like you would imagine an Hawaiian resort, the grounds beautifully landscaped. We were greeted at the entrance with leis, the first we had received since arriving in Hawaii. We went to the front desk and Ron greeted us warmly and seemed to know in advance of our prior troubles (my husband was still fuming about the chain) and entertained us with assurances and calm. At 9 a.m. our room was not ready and we certainly understood that since we had made the reservation 30 minutes earlier. In the meantime, Ron encouraged us to have breakfast and use the property while the room was being readied. We were greeted to a changing room with full bath, so that we could use the pool and beach and our valuables were safely locked up for us. The lobby areas were refreshing, breezy and really pretty with great Koi ponds. From the moment we pulled into the resort, our vacation was saved and wonderful, thanks to the Makena Beach & Golf Resort. The room with a giant balcony and oceanview was large and roomy and all amenities (coffee make, mini-frig, hairdryer, safe) were provided Our room was bright, clean and airy. We noticed that the rooms will be being redecorated during 2011, but our accommodations were great, very pleasantly appointed. The layout of the hotel and rooms are great, all the rooms seem to have an oceanview and through your room entrance, a view of the gorgeous mountainside. The gift-shop had everything one needed and was very reasonably priced. They stock sodas, chips, cookies, beer, and even stocked my favorite Merlot. There is also a coffee bar (Starbuck's coffee) with freshly made picnic foods, here the hotel offers a complimentary local newspaper Monday thru Saturday. All service was friendly, expedient and excellent. I ordered room service coffee every morning, breakfast on the balcony and late afternoon cocktails (and the room service staff seemed to anticipate my call). They seemed to know who I was and what I wanted. The food on site was excellent. An extraordinary breakfast buffet was available with inside\/outside dining everyday. The Molokini Bar & Grill for the evening was excellent, some of the best food I've eaten and Celia, our waitress, was a sweetheart. The oceanside spa was excellent and had a great massage by well-trained therapist, I melted into nirvana while inhaling a wonderful aroma under a soft ocean breeze. The beach, ah, one of the largest in Maui. Unlike the chain resort with no real beachfront, the Makena Beach & Golf Resort fronted a very big and deep beach. We stayed at the Kea Lani in 2001 and this 5 star at the time fronts a very small beach but big pools - why go to the ocean to sit at a pool; we have a pool at home. And location, location, location: at the very end of Wailea, but this is a good thing too; it is the last resort along resort-row, just above Makena Beach and Oneloa (Big Beach), making it away from the most congested tourist and shopping traffic. I can't say enough good things about this resort, we felt truly pampered during our stay and have now been introduced to the Preferred Hotel Group, we will look for them again.","date":"2015-08-16 16:59:21 +0300","ratings":{"Cleanliness":5,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":4,"Service":5,"Sleep Quality":5,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":"Île-de-France","url":"http:\/\/www.pershinghall.com\/","vacancy":true}

We live in an ocean resort on the Atlantic (Maryland), so we are no newcomers to beach\/resort hotels (at the high end). As frequent travelers, we rely pretty heavily on the reviews posted here in our decision making. I am barely able to post this review, because I fear, that if word gets out about this hotel, no one will ever be able to get a room here again. So, here goes: If you want a pretty secluded and safe beach, it's here (remember-all beaches are public in HI); if you want a very affordable, decent rate for an ocean-front no frills hotel, it's here; if you want the feel of 'old Hawaii' with all of the Aloha and the Wailea location, it's here; great food--not here, good food, yes, but not great; best sunset lounge that's not on the beach, it's here; big-time, over-the-top nightlife, not here, but good Hawaiian entertainment several nites during the week, it's here; friendly staff--Jay, Kai, Michelle, Amy to name a few--nothing is ever a problem; great bed, clean room with plenty of towels, soap, etc, it's here; if you want lots of kiddie amenities, maybe another choice is wiser; if you want quiet, quiet, quiet, a large hotel and grounds where you have space to wander and relax, this is it. If you need glitz and noise, overworked valets, and stroller races in the lobby (yes, I witnessed this on a walk-through at another hotel that has a \"four\" in its name), then go for all of that at the mouth of Wailea. Makena Beach (formerly the Maui Prince) is a wonderful alternative to the overpriced crowded chaos at the other end of this road. We are only sorry we could not stay longer--8 nites was not long enough at this little spot on Maui. (And yes, do eat at Mama's & Gannon's & Da Kitchen in Lahaina. -- all good, really good.)

We booked the trip through American Airlines Vacations in January, for travel in September. We chose the â€œ4-Starâ€� vacation package, which included 4 nights at the Maui Prince in Makena, and 3 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu. Throughout the time from January to September, I was in contact with various members of the concierge staff at the Maui Prince to plan activities for our stay. They were always so gracious and helpful, and I felt like a valued guest with every communication. Just before our trip, I learned that the Maui Prince was under new management (had become the Makena Resort), and got a little nervous about the reservations, but no worries! Everything was perfect from check-in to check-out. We were greeted with shell leis and refreshing cool towels, as well as a very friendly bell staff and front desk attendant who immediately wished us a happy anniversary and gave us an upgrade to our room at no additional charge. We were booked in a partial ocean view room, but got a beautiful ocean view room instead. It wasnâ€™t the â€œtop of the lineâ€� room, but it was ocean view, and we didnâ€™t have to pay extra! I cannot give enough praise to the staff, as they were all extremely friendly and helpful, and absolutely exuded the spirit of aloha, from the front desk to the pool bar, to the wait staff in the restaurants, and the housekeeping staff. Fabulous service â€“ always with a warm smile! The beach in front of this hotel is extremely beautiful and uncrowded. It is a small beach, but all the more cozy and private. I might add that this resort is on the southwest coast of Maui, not in the Kaâ€™anapli area up north, where it is apparently much more commercial. This resort is about a 30-minute drive from the airport. We were within 10-20 minutes of all the shopping we could ask for, from a Safeway shopping center to the Shops at Wailea, a very upscale shopping complex with stores like Gucci and Tiffanyâ€™s. The restaurants at the resort served absolutely incredible food. Be forewarned, everything in Maui is quite pricey, but if you know that before you go, there wonâ€™t be too many surprises. I just donâ€™t recommend ordering room service at the resort. One of the â€œmust-doâ€™sâ€� on Maui is a drive on the Hana Highway. Start early in the morning, though, because you will want to make several stops, and it will take you at least 4 hours to get to Hana, if there is light traffic. I recommend getting the CD-guided tour at the Shell station near the airport for $20, well worth it. There are some breathtaking views and gorgeous rainforest scenery along the way, and you will definitely want to see the black sand beach. If we had not gotten the CD package, we would have missed it. The Maui Prince\/Makena Resort has a luau one night a week, but we were not there on the right night for it, so we went to the Honuaâ€™ula Luau at the Marriott just up the road for our anniversary dinner â€“ it was AWESOME! I highly recommend it, regardless of where you stay. The food and show are worth every penny of the $100+ per person cost. I would just really like for the staff of the Maui Prince\/Makena Resort to know that they made our anniversary trip everything we dreamed it would be - the most wonderful, memorable, romantic trip we have ever taken. I just hope we can go back someday.

It was our honeymoon which we planned several months in advance. We were looking forward to relaxing for 5 nights at the Maui Prince. First off, the bell men were beyond rude. They never welcomed us with leis as we saw others being welcomed. The moquitos run rampant there which we never had any problem with riding all over Maui. The floors and rooms were dirty. Obviously, they don't clean daily. The front desk was also rude. No Aloha spirit in this place which we had gotten accustomed to in other parts of the island. They gave us a pitiful view for our prime ocean view rate. Our shower made a loud banging noise which went from hot to cold to scalding hot while you showered. It also lost most the pressure during use. We asked for a room change or maintenance to fix which they said they did during our dinner. We tried out the hotel restaurant since it' s in the middle of nowhere. The food was mediocre at best with very high prices. The service from wait staff and hostess was also snobby. The other dinner restaurant was closed for renovation til July. We decided to leave the second day but they were going to charge us the early departure fee of one night stay so the manager upgraded us to ocean front room. The view was better, room larger and separate shower but it was old and dirty also. The pool was always hot and there is only one which we were used to several. If you want a nice place to stay, you can get a better rate in Lahaina or Ka-anapali Beach at the Westin, etc with better view and many pools and restaurants. I think people go there to have quiet, but it's not going to happen if that's your reason with the nightly bird convention in lobby and loud shower and faucets. It's falling apart and in need or an upgrade or serious rate adjustments. They charge daily rate for internet and plus additional charge for parking nightly. Rape you every way they can.

We went to Maui to get married and to honeymoon. I must say, after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, they were pretty right on. Hotel The Maui Prince was great in that it was pretty secluded and quiet. The rooms were a little out-dated, but they were comfortable for our needs. The beds were nice and comfortable and everything in the room worked and was pretty clean. I would definitely recommend going for an oceanfront room. It was nice to keep the door open and sleep to the ocean (a luxury we don't get here in KY!) One thing I thought was strange was the water fountain in the garden. The grounds were very beautiful and well kept, but all we could hear until 8pm was the water fountain in the koi pond. The fountain didn't really serve a purpose and overshadowed the ocean for a while. Beach The beach was nice. We easily got lounge chairs and our pick of spots. There was even a guy from the hotel walking around making sure everyone had what they needed and offering cups of water. I would recommend taking a short drive south of the hotel to Big Beach state park. It was pretty empty when we were there and was very serene. Staff The staff was ok. It was nothing to rave about, but we didn't really have any problems. There is free valet parking (a tip of course is expected) or you can self park. I would recommend self parking. The parking lot is not far away and you save yourself the money for tips. However, the first day we arrived, the valets pounced on the car and seemed irked that we did not want to take advantage of their services (I was just being dropped off while my husband parked). Food To be honest, we only ate at the hotel once (excluding the luau). We ate at the pool grill after a day at the beach. The food was good, but pricey for what we got. Iwould highly recommend going to the Shops at Wailea for a couple of meals. Longhis was named \"best breakfast in maui\" and we couldn't agree more! Everything is homedmade, the service was great, and the atmosphere was laid back. I was hesitant at first because it looked like a fancy restaurant, but we saw people in everyhting from board shorts, to work out gear to resort wear in there for breakfast. I would also recommend have lunch or dinner at Cheeseburgers island style. Everything is ala carte on the menu. Also, if you're a pop drinker, I would get the bottomless mug. It pays for itself in 2 refills (refills are not free). If you're around any of the restaurants (wailea or lahaina), you can take the cup in for a refill. Each room has a minifridge in it. I would recommend going up to Safeway (on Pi'Ikea near Hilo Hatties) and get some drinks and snacks to keep in the room. It saves money and the hassle of running to a vending mchine. I apologize this review is lengthy, but I've always found Trip Advisor useful and wanted to share my experience.","date":"2012-11-28 13:12:46 +0300","ratings":{"Check in \/ front desk":3,"Cleanliness":3,"Location":5,"Overall":4,"Rooms":4,"Service":3,"Value":4}},{"author":"Beryl Dietrich","content":"Before booking this stay, we checked many reviews. So we tought it would be ok, except when we got there...everything was amazing! First of all, I want to adress the issue of the decor. I know hotels in the States really focus on the rooms, while for us it's more about the overall experience. The rooms aren't new, but the furniture and design are very, very classy and eternal. If remodernised now, it would end up looking just like the other hotels. This one has an elegant soul. The whole layout of the hotel is wonderful. There's the spacious terraced lobby overlooking the internal garden and the koi carp pond, also the other hotel grounds were the most beautiful tropical garden there could be. The beach in front of it is also beautiful. The views of Molokini (specially sunset and sunrise) are quite something. It's a resort, but since we went there in September after Labor day, it wasn't crowded at all. That was also noted by other reviews. Since the sheer size of the hotel, we would never really grasp the number of people staying at the time. However, when we went to the morning yoga session on the lawn overlooking the beach, it was almost like having a private instructor. The staff in general was great, helped us with planning all our other activites in Maui. About the location, yes, it fells amazingly secluded since it's the last hotel in south Makena, close to some great looking beaches (Big Beach, Small Beach, La Perouse Bay is also nearby). But if you have a rental car, and you probably want to have it for you trip to Maui, you can reach Wailea in minutes, than take the highway bypassing Kihei and from there on to the other attractions of the island. We felt that if we were to stay in Kaanapali, the drive to the other sights would have been much longer, since the road to Lahaina isn't as fast as the highway close to Kihei. Just one caveat, the shack next to the beach renting snorkling gear & other equippment is overpriced. There are many great restaurants in Maui, so we didn't eat at our hotel up to our last night when we just ordered room service. We were again surprised, the food was very good and the menu quite imaginative (for a room service menu). The breakfast buffet is a bit pricey. We would love to stay at the Maui Prince Hotel again, I don't know what the standard rates are since we booked a package through an online service (although we feel it was a bargain for the superb quality of the hotel).","date":"2015-07-19 04:27:49 +0300","ratings":{"Check in \/ front desk":5,"Cleanliness":4,"Location":5,"Overall":5,"Rooms":4,"Value":5}}],"scope":"travel","state":"Île-de-France","url":"http:\/\/paris.madeleine.hyatt.com\/hyatt\/hotels\/index.jsp?null","vacancy":false}
